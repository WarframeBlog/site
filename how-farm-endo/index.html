Today I want to show you where and how to farm endo.</p><p>Farming endo for me at least is different to farming everything else because there is only one mission that I go to farm endo and that&rsquo;s here a Hieracon on Pluto. However, I only ever go to the Hieracon when I&rsquo;ve exhausted everything else and I still need more endo because I have sort of a couple of steps that I go through every week or day depending on how much in do I need. And that&rsquo;s what I want to talk about today.</p><img class="lazyload alignnone" data-sizes="auto" title="Warframe Maroo&#39;s Bazaar a way to get ayatan sculpture" alt="easy way to get ayatan sculpture" data-src="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/warframe-hunt-for-ayatan-treasure-1024x576.png" data-srcset="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/warframe-hunt-for-ayatan-treasure-1024x576.png 1024w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/warframe-hunt-for-ayatan-treasure-300x169.png 300w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/warframe-hunt-for-ayatan-treasure-768x432.png 768w"><p>So, step number one is always the weekly ayatan mission. Every week you get a special mission given to you by Maroo in her Bazaar. All you have to do here is simply go to Maroo&rsquo;s Bazaar which is located on earth talk to Maroo and tell her that you&rsquo;re looking for ayatan treasures. This will trigger a special mission that takes place either in the Void or Derelict and all you have to do in the mission simply head over to one of the timed rooms and reach the end before the door closes. If you manage to do it in time there will be an ayatan sculpture waiting for you at the end and that&rsquo;s the mission done you can head to extraction.</p><img class="lazyload alignnone" data-sizes="auto" title="Warframe Ayatan Sculpture at the end of the Hunt" alt=" Ayatan Sculpture is waiting for you at the end of every hunt" data-src="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/warframe-pick-up-ayatan-sculpture-1024x576.png" data-srcset="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/warframe-pick-up-ayatan-sculpture-1024x576.png 1024w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/warframe-pick-up-ayatan-sculpture-300x169.png 300w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/warframe-pick-up-ayatan-sculpture-768x432.png 768w"><p>The sculptures as they are aren&rsquo;t usually worth too much endo though the one I got was 375 but once I put all three stars into it jumped up to 1725. And that is a nice chunk of endo from something that took like five minutes to do. And all that has to do is head back to Maroo&rsquo;s Bazaar and have the endo extracted from the sculpture.</p><p>After that&rsquo;s done I head over to sorties because while the majority of people including me do sorties to get legendary cores and <a href="https://warframeblog.com/ways-earn-platinum/">riven mods</a> let&rsquo;s face it we are probably going to get endo. So, simply blast through all three of the sorties which most of the time takes somewhere between ten to twenty minutes and at the end I either get really lucky and I get a legendary core or riven mod or I get a <a href="https://warframeblog.com/where-and-how-to-farm-kuva/">kuva</a> or I get endo.</p><p>Now I&rsquo;ve done with sorties I do one more thing before I head to Hieracon and that syndicate missions.</p><img class="lazyload alignnone" data-sizes="auto" title="Warframe Syndicate missions are another way to get endo" alt="You might find Ayatan Sculpture when looking for syndicate medallions" data-src="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/warframe-syndicate-mission-way-to-get-endo-1024x576.png" data-srcset="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/warframe-syndicate-mission-way-to-get-endo-1024x576.png 1024w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/warframe-syndicate-mission-way-to-get-endo-300x169.png 300w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/warframe-syndicate-mission-way-to-get-endo-768x432.png 768w"><p>Now, you might be asking: why the hell would you do syndicate missions to get endo? Well, here&rsquo;s the thing, ayatan sculptures can spawn randomly in missions but most of the time when you&rsquo;re doing missions you&rsquo;re not going to check every nook and cranny to find them. So, most of the time you just miss them you run past them. But when you&rsquo;re doing syndicate missions you want to get all the medallions so, you are checking every nook and cranny of the tileset. So, chances are if an ayatan sculpture has spawned you&rsquo;re going to find it.</p><p>And by the way, the reason why I farm syndicate medallions is to have a buffer of syndicate reputation for what a new <a href="https://warframeblog.com/how-to-farm-relics/">relic</a> is released with a new primed item because this way I&rsquo;m able to get sort of 1 million reputations between my two syndicates. So, as soon as they drop the new <a href="https://warframeblog.com/how-to-farm-relics/">relics</a> there&rsquo;s a pretty good chance I&rsquo;m going to get some of them from the relic packs. However, if you do want to do this wait for a day or so because sometimes they forget to add the new relics to the relic packs.</p><p>Now, I might be in the best way to find the medallions and sculptures if they spawned in the mission is to bring up the big map which is done on PC at least by pressing M by default and using the <a href="https://warframeblog.com/ignis-wraith-build/">Ignis</a> and loot radar which you can get from multiple different sources. The one I use personally is Animal Instinct. And this combination is really good because medallions and turn sculptures resource drops and containers are all marked with a white square on the map so, all you have to do is simply run around with your Ignis and spray in the vague direction of these squares and if they don&rsquo;t disappear once you spray them it&rsquo;s either a resource drop and an ayatan sculpture or a medallion. It also breaks all the containers even through walls so, it makes it pretty good for farming ayatan stars as well. Now, this is not the best way of farming endo because most of the time you&rsquo;re just going to get bugger all but if you get lucky you can get a nice sculpture that can sell for quite a bit of endo.</p><p>And finally as I said in the beginning if I&rsquo;m done with all of that I head over to Hieracon on Pluto and the reason I go to the Hieracon is because the rotation a which is excavators 1 and 2, 5 and 6, 9 and 10 and so on and so on and so on have a chance of rewarding you with a 400 endo pack though sometimes the RNG may not be on your side and it feels like you&rsquo;re kind of getting shafted because you just do a ton of excavators and it&rsquo;s just <a href="https://warframeblog.com/farm-credits-750k-credits-per-hour/">credits</a>. And it&rsquo;s frustrating but it&rsquo;s still a really good way of getting endo especially if you land in a group that wants to do a 2k run so, you do 20 excavators or a 1.2 K so, you do 12. There is a pretty good chance you&rsquo;re going to get at least one endo pack there</p><p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that by doing all the previous things we are going to get a ton of duplicate mods so, head over to your mod station or whatever it is called sort them by duplicates and dissolve them into endo. I always forget to do this and then I realize I have like 3000 duplicate mods and I sell them and I get a nice chunk of endo from it as well.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s how I farm endo in Warframe. So, I thank you very much for reading. I hope the article was helpful and I will see you next time.
