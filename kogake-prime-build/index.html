Welcome to another Warframe article and today I want to take a quick look at our newest breakdance enabling device the Kogake Prime.</p><p>Now, if you want to get your hands on this device the Blueprint is an uncommon drop from the Axi V7 <a href="https://warframeblog.com/how-to-farm-relics/">relic</a>, the Boot is a common drop from the Axi A3 relic and the Gauntlet is a rare drop from the Meso K1 relic. Just bear in mind that you will have to get two gauntlets and two boots.</p><p>The new Kogake Prime requires you to be at least mastery rank ten to use it. It does 70 damage with each hit: 49 is impact, 10.5 is puncture, and 10.5 is slash. It is 34% status chance, 16% crit chance with a 1.8 times multiplier and it is attack speed of 0.917 which is actually pretty slow. So, if you want this to feel good I would very much recommend you use Berserker or Fury or even the primed version of Fury.</p><p>Just like the other sparring weapons or sparring stances, I should say sprint speed or movement speed, in general, is amazing. Because while the combos do allow you to move around and even sprint while you&rsquo;re performing them they slaw you down quite considerably so, sprint speed makes them feel a lot better. Which is why the hidden bonus of the Kogake Prime is so cool because they increase your movement speed by 5% if you&rsquo;re in melee mode. It doesn&rsquo;t, unfortunately, work if you&rsquo;re wielding a primary or a secondary weapon. Now, I know that 5% doesn&rsquo;t sound like an awful lot and it&rsquo;s not if you slap it onto something slow like Frost but if you have a fast warframe or you stack sprint speed like I do on my Inaros, it actually ends up being somewhat noticeable and it gives you a nice chunk of movement speed.</p><p>Now, I ended up using a 0 forma build because the Kogake Prime comes with three V&rsquo;s as standard which is more than enough for a build, especially on a melee weapon where you get additional capacity from a stance. And I just had to go full on the status and just not bother with crit at all.</p><img class="lazyload alignnone" data-sizes="auto" title="Warframe Kogake Prime Build" alt="Kogake Prime Build that I use" data-src="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/warframe-kogake-prime-build-1024x366.png" data-srcset="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/warframe-kogake-prime-build-1024x366.png 1024w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/warframe-kogake-prime-build-300x107.png 300w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/warframe-kogake-prime-build-768x274.png 768w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/warframe-kogake-prime-build.png 1531w"><p>So, the stance I&rsquo;m using is Brutal Tide because it matches the polarity but both of the sparring stances are pretty good. And I stopped on Primed Fever Strike so, I get a lot more toxin damage which combines with Virulent Scourge and Voltaic Strike into a ton of corrosive damage and a lot of status chance.</p><p>Then we have Volcanic Edge which adds a little bit of heat damage which is great versus flash especially since the weapon doesn&rsquo;t do a ton of slash damage and it adds, even more, status chance. After that, we have Condition Overload which is gonna increase our melee damage by a crazy amount for each status effect we have on the enemy and Berserker for that too lovely attack speed. And I would once again very much recommend Berserker or Fury or the primed version of Fury.</p><p>And don&rsquo;t worry 16% crit chance is more than enough to sustain your Berserker procs. Then, of course, we&rsquo;re gonna add Prime Pressure Points for some melee damage and finally Drifting Contact for a little bit of extra status chance and increase combo duration.</p><p>Now, you could go with Body Count to get a longer combo duration just bear in mind that it will drop your status down to 95%. Now, at first I did want to squeeze in crit into the build as well with the Blood Rush and Organ Chatter but in the end, it just didn&rsquo;t feel worth it because I was losing a ton of status chance. I was losing a ton of corrosive damage because I wasn&rsquo;t using Primed Fever Strike anymore and there wasn&rsquo;t enough mod space for the Volcanic Edge mod so, I lost the heat element which was in a Condition Overload setup is a pretty big deal. It wasn&rsquo;t awful when I got lucky and I got crits back to back from the start it was actually pretty damn strong but it just felt way less consistent than this setup.  And in my setup it is. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting amazing result because the weapon is primarily impact base. And impact isn&rsquo;t that great versus flesh and armor especially once you push the enemies up to sortie level so, around level 100. But, holy crap, this thing does a lot of damage. The best thing about this is that it is a sparring weapon so, you&rsquo;re pretty much just breakdancing enemies to death. It is just amazing. The animations you get with the sparring weapons just look so damn good. And it&rsquo;s even better if they&rsquo;re actually, you know, doing some damage. I think my favorite animation has to be the regular finisher.</p><p>I absolutely adore Sparring weapons I think they are some of the most fun weapons you can use in the game because both of the stances are just over the top rule of cool. I just love it, they look so good. It feels good to play with them as well if you have enough attack and movement speed because if you&rsquo;re missing one of those they&rsquo;re gonna feel pretty sluggish. It&rsquo;s not quite as much fun as running around with a really fast Tempo Royale setup like I have on my Galatine Prime but it&rsquo;s close. This is one of those weapons that I can just take into a survival and stay there for an hour plus because of how much damn fun it is. It&rsquo;s the type of weapon that makes you run out of life support because you&rsquo;re just not paying attention. It is awesome so, I would definitely recommend you pick this up if you have the opportunity. I thank you very much for reading as always guys and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.</p></article></div><div class="col-md-1"></div><div class="col-md-3 ml-auto mr-auto"><aside class="sidebar"><div><h4 class="title">Popular Guides</h4><ul><li><a href="https://warframeblog.com/balor-fomorian-event/" title="Balor Fomorian Event Guide">Balor Fomorian Event Guide</a></li><li><a href="https://warframeblog.com/top-arcanes-to-boost-your-damage/" title="TOP 5 Arcanes To Boost Your Damage">TOP 5 Arcanes To Boost Your Damage</a></li><li><a href="https://warframeblog.com/get-started-plains-of-eidolon/" title="How to get started in Plains of Eidolon">How to get started in Plains of Eidolon</a></li><li><a href="https://warframeblog.com/how-earn-platinum-vault-runs/" title="How to earn Platinum | Vault Runs">How to earn Platinum | Vault Runs</a></li><li><a href="https://warframeblog.com/how-to-get-hydroid/" title="How to get Hydroid">How to get Hydroid</a></li><li><a href="https://warframeblog.com/warframe-arbitrations-alerts-guide/" title="Warframe Arbitrations: Lethal Alerts Guide">Warframe Arbitrations: Lethal Alerts Guide</a></li><li><a href="https://warframeblog.com/affinity-how-level-up/" title="Affinity Mechanic – How to Level up Correctly">Affinity Mechanic – How to Level up Correctly</a></li></ul></div><div><h4 class="title">Follow Us</h4><a class="twitter-timeline lazyload" href="https://twitter.com/warframeblog?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-tweet-limit="2" data-lang="en" data-script="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js">Tweets by warframeblog</a></div><div><h4 class="title">Farm Resources Right</h4><ul><li><a href="https://warframeblog.com/warframe-plastids-farming/" title="Warframe Plastids Farming">Warframe Plastids Farming</a></li><li><a href="https://warframeblog.com/oxium-farming/" title="Oxium Farming">Oxium Farming</a></li><li><a href="https://warframeblog.com/warframe-neurodes-farming/" title="Warframe Neurodes Farming">Warframe Neurodes Farming</a></li><li><a href="https://warframeblog.com/how-farm-endo/" title="How To Farm Endo">How To Farm Endo</a></li><li><a href="https://warframeblog.com/toroids-farming/" title="How and Where to get Toroids">How and Where to get Toroids</a></li></ul></div><div><h4 class="title">Popular Builds</h4><ul><li><a href="https://warframeblog.com/akbolto-prime-build/" title="Akbolto Prime Build">Akbolto Prime Build</a></li><li><a href="https://warframeblog.com/stradavar-prime-build/" title="Stradavar Prime Build">Stradavar Prime Build</a></li><li><a href="https://warframeblog.com/amprex-build/" title="Amprex Build">Amprex Build</a></li><li><a href="https://warframeblog.com/dual-keres-build/" title="Dual Keres Build">Dual Keres Build</a></li><li><a href="https://warframeblog.com/quartakk-build/" title="Quartakk build">Quartakk build</a></li><li><a href="https://warframeblog.com/kogake-prime-build/" title="Kogake Prime Build">Kogake Prime Build</a></li></ul></div></aside></div></div></div><section class="related-posts"><div class="container"><div class="text-center"><h2 class="title">Related Posts</h2></div><div class="row"><article class="col-md-4"><div class="card card-plain card-blog"><div class="card-header card-header-image"><a href="https://warframeblog.com/mirage-prime-build/" title="Mirage Prime Build"><img class="img img-raised lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/warframe-mirage-prime-overview-360x240.jpg" title="Mirage Prime Build" alt="Mirage Prime Build image"></a></div><div class="card-body"><h6 class="card-category text-success"><a href="https://warframeblog.com/builds" title="View all posts in Builds">Builds</a></h6><h4 class="card-title"><a href="https://warframeblog.com/mirage-prime-build/" title="Mirage Prime Build">Mirage Prime Build</a></h4><p class="card-description">Hello everyone!
