                            <p class="about-builds">Each warframe you can build in a thousand different ways and there’s a lot of room for tweaking on your end, so please don’t take it as if builds below were set in stone. You can of course copy builds exactly and it’s going to work just fine, but I would think about Warframe Builds below as more of an inspiration for your own builds because you can play around with different values: duration, efficiency, range, and even strength. And as long as you don’t stray too far away from the original idea of these warfame builds, it should still work. You’re not going to break it.</p>

Next, we have &lt;a href=&#39;/banshee-savage-silence-build/&#39;&gt;Banshee Savage Silence Build&lt;/a&gt; which is my favorite focus farming build because it&#39;s simply faster and more active than lots of other focus farming builds.

The second one is &lt;a href=&#39;/excalibur-radial-javelin-build/&#39;&gt;Radial Javelin Build&lt;/a&gt; and it does a very nice damage over a pretty sizable area.

The first one is &lt;a href=&#39;/trinity-energy-vampire-build/&#39;&gt;Trinity EV Build&lt;/a&gt; and it focuses on Energy Vampire and the vampire leech augment so it provides a lot of energy and over shields to your entire team and can also do some really nice burst healing with the Blessing. The second one is &lt;a href=&#39;/trinity-blessing-build/&#39;&gt;Trinity Blessing Build&lt;/a&gt; and it focuses on Blessing and it’s geared more towards providing massive damage reduction as well as healing to your entire team.">

He is highly versatile, armed with powerful abilities that can damage enemies, provide cover and complement the ranged and melee combat of his cell. The electrical nature of his abilities make him highly effective against the Corpus, with their robots in particular." data-builds="So, the three builds I have for Volt are: number one the &lt;a href=&#39;/volt-speed-build/&#39;&gt;Volt Speed Build&lt;/a&gt; which unsurprisingly focuses on speed, then number two the Volt Eidolon Hunter Build which is focused more around his shield and finally at number three we have the &lt;a href=&#39;/volt-discharge-build/&#39;&gt;Volt Capacitance Build&lt;/a&gt; which focuses more on Discharge.">
