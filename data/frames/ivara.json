Tapping the ability button will cycle through the different arrow types and holding it will shoot the currently selected arrow.</p><p>First we have the Cloak Arrow. Ivara shoots an arrow that clings to a surface or entity, generating a bubble that will cloak Ivara and any allies within it. There is a maximum number of bubbles that can be active at the same time. Creating another one will remove the oldest. Next we have Dashwire Arrow. Ivara shoots an arrow that creates a zipline between her and the target location. There is a maximum number of ziplines that can be active at the same time. Then we have Noise Arrow. Ivara shoots an arrow that creates noise on impact, drawing unalerted enemies close to it to investigate. Finally we have Sleep Arrow. Enemies within a certain radius of its point of impact will be put to sleep for a period of time. Sleeping enemies will wake up prematurely when they take enough damage.</p>",

She can also take control of a projectile currently in flight. The projectile can be steered with the aiming reticle and will accelerate when pressing the fire button. Pressing the aim button will slow it down. While the projectile is being controlled, it gains additional damage per second, up to a maximum based on a damage multiplier. Navigator will drain energy while a projectile is being controlled.",

She is also capable of pickpocketing enemies. Standing close to enemies has a chance to produce extra loot after a few seconds but it only works once for each enemy and only one enemy can be pickpocketed at a time. This is a channeled ability. It will remain active, until it’s deactivated. However, using a non-silent weapon will reveal Ivara momentarily. If Ivara sprints, slides or bullet jumps, the ability will deactivate and must be reactivated manually. Prowl will constantly drain energy, draining more when Ivara is moving or using melee attacks.",

Each shot will cost energy and shoots several arrows in a vertical orientation. Holding down the fire button to perform a charged shot will spread the arrows horizontally instead. Using the alternate fire button while the Artemis Bow is active will instantly fire Quiver’s currently selected arrow. Ability Strength mods affect the maximum damage multiplier of Navigator, the headshot bonus and steal chance of Prowl and the damage of Artemis Bow.
