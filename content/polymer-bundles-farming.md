Hey guys and welcome to another [Warframe farming guide](/farming/ "Farming Resources in Warframe"). Today I want to show you where and how to farm polymer bundles.<!--more-->

So, first of all you'll have to unlock your Star Chart all the way up to Uranus for this to work and always go in a group of four. Also, I recommend you to use a resource booster to get far more polymer bundles of your farming time.

As for the squad, I suggest you to take you at least one [Hydroid](/warframes/hydroid/) with [Pilfering Swarm](/hydroid-pilfering-swarm-build/ "Hydroid Pilfering Swarm Build") and at least one [Nekros](/warframes/nekros/ "Warframe Nekros") with [Despoil](/nekros-desecrate-build/ "Nekros Desecrate Build") for optimal results.

## Where to Farm Polymer Bundles

And the first spot is <b>Assur in Uranus</b> which is an infested survival mission. You need to find a tight room and just camp. Let Hydroid do his thing. So, in 15 minutes I was able to obtain upwards of ten thousand polymer bundles using a resource booster in a group of four.

So, the other spot is <b>Ophelia which is also in Uranus</b> and it's a Grineer survival mission. Again don't mess with the strategy find a tight room preferably one with the dead end and just camp. So, in Ophelia I was able to obtain upwards of 8,500 polymer bundles in the same amount of time.

And thatâ€™s pretty much all I wanted to say. So, I thank you very much for reading. I hope that it helps you out to farm lots of polymer bundles and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
