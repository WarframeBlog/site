Hey guys and welcome to another Weapon Build article. Today we're going to take a quick look at our newest secondary weapon that was released with update 25 - the Cyanex.<!--more-->

So, first things first, if you want to get your hands on this weapon you will first have to research it in the Energy Lab in your Dojo. And if you then want to build it you have to put in 20,000 credits, five Fieldron, 8750 Nano Spores, 250 [Hexenon](/hexenon-farming/ "How and Where to get Hexenon"), and one Forma. 

## Cyanex Full Auto Mode
The Cyanex requires to be at least mastery rank 8 to use it and it has a 91 damage per shot: 50 out of which is impact and 41 is Gas. The weapon comes with a very low critical chance of only 8%, a below-average critical multiplier of 1.4x but it does have very high status chance at 32%. You can also fire up to 4.67 rounds per second which is quite fast. It only has an 11 round magazine with 110 rounds in total, and it has a pretty lengthy 2.2 second reload, especially considering the fire rate and the magazine size. 

## Cyanex Burst Mode
Though this is only the full auto mode which by the way has terrible accuracy and will spread shots all over the place. There's also a burst fire mode which you can initiate by pressing the secondary fire button, and this for the most part has the same stats as the full auto mode but it does 72 damage per shot with a 38.9 being slash, 30.2 being puncture, and 2.9 being impact with no Gas whatsoever. 

It also has 0.5 meters of punch through and uses a different fire mechanic where if you press the secondary fire button it fires out the rest of your magazine with a fire rate of 10.05 rounds per second. And finally, all shots fired with the Cyanex create a small 1 meter explosion on impact that does a little bit of AoE and deal self damage.

Now, in the end, I ended up putting on three forma, all three of which were a V, and I have several Cyanex builds that I want to share with you. 

## Cyanex Build 
So, for Corpus and Infested I like to use this Cyanex Build:

with Hornet Strike for damage Barrel Diffusion for multishot, Lethal Torrent for fire rate and multishot. Then Augur Pact for some extra damage, Stunning Speed for some reload speed and a little bit of status chance. And then I have Scorch, Pathogen Rounds, and Pistol Pestilence for some status chance and lots of gas damage. 

## Cyanex Anti-Grineer Build
And if I ever want to fight high-leve Grineer I will go with Jolt and Pistol Pestilence for corrosive damage and Scorch for heat damage.

2.29
Now as you may have noticed already this open is a bit of a particle cannon and I'm not entirely sure how well YouTube is going to take this clip so if it looks like ass my apologies but you can see that the weapon is actually quite good even with the sort of spray-and-pray primary fire you can do quite a bit of damage and it procs an insane amount of stages and if you then switch into the secondary fire and you just burst fire your entire magazine into an enemy yeah you can burst down even Xochitl of a gurney and as far as the gas build is concerned well it's a gas build on a weapon with a really high fire rate for high stages and an eighth explosion that just covers everything in death 

However, this is not the only way you can build the Cyanex. You can also go for a build like this: 

We'll just go for pure Condition Overload support with Barrel Diffusion for multishot Lethal Torrent for firing to multishot pistol patterns and frostbite for viral jolt and scorch for radiation and then I personally went with stunning speed for reload and quick draw for even more reload and this actually works surprisingly well especially when you have by a really beefy condition overload weapon but mostly because what you can do is just spray the smaller units with a primary fire and just broke a ton of elemental statuses but if you then run into something a little bit beefier what you can do is just burst it with a secondary fire which Brooks every stage effect in the world and then just slap them and they die 

and now we come to the conclusion so what do I actually think about the Cyanex well my journey with this one was a little bit harder because I liked it when I first picked it out then I wasn't so sure when I was leveling it and then I ended up liking it in the end again and I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that you have a lot of flexibility when it comes to the Belle the build is not set in stone you can tinker around with it and change few things here and there and ultimately just make it do what you wanted to do if you just want to run around be like gasps go outlaw and just demolish the star chart you can do that if you want to make it a little bit more useful and put on corrosive or viral or radiation you can do that you can add even more utility you get some punch through you can add fire aid you can dump down the reload even more with Frank quick-draw or you can just you know use it as a support weapon for your condition overload melee and I always appreciate that even though there is an obvious best way of building this which is to support a condition of overload melee so oh no I am going to give this one a thumbs up I think it's fun it's pretty strong and I think you should definitely check it out and that is pretty much all I had to say so I think you very much for watching as always guys I hope you've enjoyed the article and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
