Hey guys and welcome to another Warframe guide. Today I want to talk a little bit about animal preservation. 

So, the first thing you have to do is to go to the Biz(the Business NPC) and buy yourself a <b>Tranq Rifle</b> and any of the <b>Echo Lures</b> that you have available. You will only be able to buy the poppers one to begin with but you'll be able to buy additional lures as you progress through the different ranks with Solaris United. Once you buy the Tranq Rifle and some of the Lures you want to go into your gear wheel and equip at least a Tranq Rifle. You do not have to equip the Lures. 

Once that's done you want to head out into Orb Vallis and equip either the Tranq Rifle which will mark every single animal that you can track on the map or alternatively if you're looking to hunt down a specific animal you want to equip that animal's Lure which will narrow it down and only show you the starting points for the hunt for that animal. 

Now, tracking the animals is pretty straightforward. You simply go to one of the icons that will show up on the map where you will find a pile of poop. After that you go up to the poop, you poke the poop, and that will reveal a set of tracks that you need to follow to a <b>call point</b>. Now these tracks will always take you all the way from the pile of poop to the call point where you actually have to use the Lure. There are no gaps in them and they will actually glow when you're close to them however they can still be pretty hard to see sometimes especially in the fungal and rocky areas. They're pretty easy to see on snow. However, you don't necessarily have to follow the tracks to find the call point because the game will also put a yellow circle on the map which is sort of the general area where the call point is. So, you can just run around this yellow circle until you find the call point. 

Once you make your way to the call point you want to take out the right Lure, use it, and wait for the animal to respond. This will give you a pitch guide so what you need to do is line yourself with the guide, press the fire button, and look up and down to follow it. You only have to nail the pitch once or twice. And once it's done you switch back to your Tranq Rifle and wait for the animal to show up so you can tranq it. But you have to be careful and quick because at least the //poppers and vermin// are very easily spooked and if they get spooked they will run away and you will lose them. 

After the animal appears you need to pop up your Tranq Rifle and shoot it. Then you walk up to it, press the use button, and that will capture the animal. 

Now, the animal conservation is much easier to do with Ivara because neither the Tranq Rifle nor the Lure will break your stealth permanently. And the animals can get spooked by something they can't see so it makes the final part much easier. Well, it actually makes everything easier because you're invisible so the Corpus and the Arachnids will leave you alone. 

And finally, each animal has three different subspecies: common, uncommon, and rare. Each one of those subspecies has a different tag that you will get once you catch the animal. These tags can be exchanged for different types of floofs which are orbiter decorations at the shop that's owned by Biz. And that's pretty much all I have to say about animal conservation. I hope you've enjoyed this Fortuna Animal Conservation Guide and it was helpful. And I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
