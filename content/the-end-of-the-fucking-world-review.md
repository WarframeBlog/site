Hello everyone! Let&#8217;s talk about The End of the Fucking World. No, it&#8217;s not a political article it&#8217;s just the name of the latest Netflix show.Â <!--more-->

I&#8217;m not sure exactly why but I went into this show thinking that I was gonna hate it. From the trailer and from the little I knew about it I felt like it was going to be some weak appeal to teenagers and there was going to be a lot of meaningless whining and angst and it was just going to be like super annoying. And then I saw it&#8217;s only eight episodes about twenty minutes each so pretty much the quickest watch ever and I thought let&#8217;s give it a shot. And from episode one I was like okay I was a hundred percent wrong about this show. This is great!

## What is The End of the Fucking World about?

So, The End of the Fucking World tells the story of two teenagers James and Alyssa. Both of them are weird kids. They don&#8217;t really fit in. Both of them had a pretty messed-up childhood they can&#8217;t really find their place. James sort of made peace with that he thinks he&#8217;s a psychopath. So, through that lens the way he is and the things he does or doesn&#8217;t care about make sense to him. Alyssa lets herself experience her emotions a bit more but she also can&#8217;t just be the normal kid people expect her to be. And all of this is, of course, is combined with your teenage angst and your lack of perspective you have when you&#8217;re a teenager. When you&#8217;re so young everything feels like it&#8217;s the most important thing in the world. Everything can be, well, The End of the Fucking World. So, James and Alissa sort of find each other in the small town they live in. And they end up going on this journey together that leads them to unexpected places while their relationship starts to blossom.

## The End of the Fucking World review

I feel this show just did everything right. The episodes are super short some of them are less than 20 minutes long. So, the show doesn&#8217;t waste time on anything. Within 2 or 3 episodes you can already understand so much about James and Alyssa and their insecurities and what they need from each other why they ran away. And when they do something stupid or impulsive it feels like something they would do or something someone their age who&#8217;s been through the same things they have would do because The End of the Fucking World is not here to show you how annoying teenagers are. It&#8217;s not here to say that all kids are self-entitled and spoiled and stupid. It might sound cheesy but this show is here to tell you how these two kids sort of find themselves through this really sweet love story that also takes them to really horrible messed-up places. And I think that&#8217;s a really hard thing to do because teenagers are annoying and stupid and I&#8217;m sorry if you&#8217;re a teenager but it&#8217;s perfectly fine we&#8217;ve all been there and most of us are still annoying and stupid, so you&#8217;ve got that to look forward to.

But with The End of the Fucking World, I didn&#8217;t find myself annoyed with these characters at all. I just felt for them and I was moved by their relationship. Even when I was watching 13 Reasons Why there are moments where characters were like &#8220;nobody gets me&#8221; and in that show, it&#8217;s also all in context and it makes sense and everything. In this show though when they acted out it felt like it made sense and it felt real and you knew where it was coming from. Which is all super impressive for such a short show. There are things that British television just does better &#8211; fantastic character development over a short span of episodes happens on British TV more than anywhere else I&#8217;ve seen. And aside from all of that The End of the Fucking World just fun. It&#8217;s a quick watch. The episodes fly by. It&#8217;s super fast-paced. The banter between James and Alyssa is funny and the show perfectly balances the fast-paced and fun with the bleakness of the things it talks about and the really horrible things that happen in this show. These kids go through some rough stuff.

## Should you watch The End of the Fucking World?

Definitely! Why not? It&#8217;s a lot of goodness in a very small package. It manages to tackle heavy stuff without really being a heavy show and story-wise it does take quite a few unexpected twists which is why I didn&#8217;t really talk about the story that much because it&#8217;s fun to experience it. You can watch the whole thing on a weekend afternoon and I would say that would be an afternoon well-spent. This article was kind of quick. I didn&#8217;t have a lot of time to go into all of my thoughts in detail. But, instead of listening to me, you might as well just go and watch an episode of this show.
