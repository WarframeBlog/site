Every **Secondary Weapon in Warframe** you can build in a thousand various ways, and there is plenty of room to tweak it on your end, therefore please don't take it as if the **Weapon Builds** below were carved in stone. You can copy any build precisely, and it's going to work fine, of course, but I'd think of **Secondary Weapon Builds** below as more of an inspiration for your builds because you can play around with different values: critical chance, status chance, critical multiplier, damage, and even type of damage. And as long as you're not straying too far from these **Secondary Weapon Builds** original idea, it should still work.
