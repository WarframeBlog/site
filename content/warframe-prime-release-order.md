Hey guys and welcome all of you who are waiting when Nidus Prime, Equinox Prime, Mesa Prime, and generally any prime Warframe will be released. Today I want to show you in which order they probably will be coming out. <!--more-->

So, the order in which Prime Warframes are released can be predicted, most of the time. Weapons and accessories that come with Primes are impossible to predict of course. But besides that, it's fairly simple to have an estimated guess on what will come next. 

*Before I continue, please note that even though these predictions are somewhat accurate, you should not take this as "100% confirmed". Digital Extremes can change the order of Primes at any time they want, so please take my word with a molecule of sand.*

Here's a quick summary of **how Primes work**. Primes are released in the order of *male, male, female, female*. The releases have been fairly straightforward. Warframes have been Primed in order of *seniority*, that is the oldest Warframes get Primed over newer Warframes. This has been the case all the way up until Nova Prime. Speculation says that the only reason Nova was Primed was because she was a popular Warframe at the time, and Digital Extremes wanted to rake in the dosh, because it was nearing Christmas in 2014.

## Current Warframe Prime Order
The current order is:

| <b>Warframe & Weapons</b> | <b>Release date</b>      | <b>Sex</b>    |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------ | 
| Excalibur Prime, along with Lato Prime and Skana Prime | 18 December, 2012 | Male   |
| [Frost Prime](/), along with [Latron Prime](/) and [Reaper Prime](/) - <br/>[Frost Prime Access](/chroma-prime-access/)| 5 March, 2013 | Male   |
| Mag Prime, along with  Dakra Prime and Boar Prime | 13 September, 2013 | Male   |

## Prime Frame Future Release Order
Anyways, as long as DE does not decide to Prime warframe early again, the order probably will be: Zephyr, Limbo, Chroma, Mesa, Equinox, Atlas, Wukong, Ivara, Titania, Nezha, Inaros, Octavia, Gara, Nidus, and Harrow. 

That is what the order should be as long as nothing gets changed again, but please keep in mind that the month in which they might be released is an extremely rough estimate. I strongly advise you to <b>not take the predicted release date as "OMG Prime ACCESS CONFIRMED IN APRIL"</b>, because again, it's a bit tough to determine exactly when the next Prime Access will be out, since in terms of release, they're a tad bit unreliable. Also note that this order does not take Umbra frames into account, as Umbra is a completely different line of Warframes compared to Prime, not to mention that Umbra will be more tied to the in-game lore than Prime. That's about all I can guess for now. I thank you very much for reading and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
