Hello everyone and today we are going to discuss some tips on defeating the newly upgraded Hemocyte boss. The last event we all complained about the boss being a copy and paste of Lephantis and also we complained that the boss was very easy to kill and that it was weak. So, DE listened to that and this time they made it harder. Now it's much like fighting an Eidolon.<!--more-->

So, after you escort of the drone and kill some of the infested you will trigger appearing of the first Hemocyte. It will have three heads: Corpus head, Grineer head, Ancient head. You have to shoot the glowing parts when they open their heads or when they open their flaps.

The easiest one to kill is going to be the Corpus head. It stays open a lot longer than the rest so you want to take that one first. Now, after that has been destroyed go for the Ancient head. That is going to be the one that has the white snout. The goal is for the entire squad to focus all their shots and all their attacks towards one head at a time.

Once the Ancient head is down then you have the Grineer head and this is going to be the tougher one. This is the hardest one because it doesn't stay open as much as you would like. And most of the time that it stays open is when it does an attack. At this point, the Hemocyte will start slamming the site into the ground and start swinging it. On a slam attack, you will receive a shock wave like Eidolons and a swing will also kill you in one single hit.

The Hemocyte right now is somewhat identical to the Eidolon Hydrolyst. So, if you ever captured the Hydrolyst or the Ganulyst before you have a great idea on how this is going to work.

Now, as far as the weapons of choice and the warframes of choice I will suggest bringing a similar setup to the ones you use on your [Eidolons](https://warframeblog.com/spawn-defeat-gantulyst-hydrolyst/) squads - a damage frame, a buffing frame, a healer, and this time a CC frame or another frame for occasional immunity. I will suggest using [Oberon](https://warframeblog.com/oberon-eidolon-hunter-build/), Chroma, [Rhino](https://warframeblog.com/rhino-roar-build/), [Nova](https://warframeblog.com/nova-slow-build/), and Vauban because those will be a great thing and a great addition to your squad. And if you like you can bring a [Trinity](https://warframeblog.com/trinity-blessing-build/) as well.

Now, I have seen Titania's Razorwing as a great addition because you can fly around and get some of those tight spots and a lot of people also said it works very well. So, go ahead and try her as well if you play Titania and if you enjoy how she works.

Now, lastly, we have the weapons. Here I can only advice you to bring rapid-fire weapons and also shotguns. So, I found my best choice to be a crit weapon. I personally use the Soma Prime or sometimes Vaykor Hek, Tigris Prime or Arca Plasmor but feel free to use whatever you like. Now, as for [melee](https://warframeblog.com/melee-weapons/), I use the Zenistar to keep the infested away so that way I can create a wave around myself and have a good clear sight to take down quick shots.

Now with all that said I must say this is going to be an amazing event because I wasn't expecting this amazing change and I have to say that I love it. I love that the upgraded Hemocyte is quite more challenging and a lot harder than it used to be but you know what it's only a matter of time before someone goes out there and solo it. So, thank you very much for reading this article. Hope this information helps you and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
