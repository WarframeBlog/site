Hey guys and welcome to another Warframe build article. As you probably know, Resonating Quake mod got changed last month and because of that today we're going to take a look at some Banshee Resonating Quake Builds and find out if the mod is still worth it or not.<!--more-->

Besides Banshee Resonating Quake Build you might be interested in others [Banshee builds](https://warframeblog.com/warframe-builds/). Well, if that is the case, you should definitely check out these two builds: the [Banshee Resonance Build](https://warframeblog.com/banshee-resonance-build/) and the [Banshee Savage Silence Build](https://warframeblog.com/banshee-savage-silence-build/).

Let's back to the Resonating Quake Build. At first, many people started complaining&#8230; it is a nerf, but is it really? Definitely not. Sound Quake with the Resonating Quake augment mod isn't a channeling ability anymore. Now it's a re-castable ability that still deals 20x the damage with an increased radius.

The most important change here is the way this mod drains your energy. Because it's not a channeling ability anymore it now only costs 25 energy per cast and 6.25 energy with an Efficiency of 175%.

Because of a simple change like that, it is even better than it was before and can be used in many other situations. Banshee is now actually a really good nuke warframe for all the different type of missions.

Also, Banshee is still one of the best nuke warframe for Helene or Hydron. With such a low energy consumption you will never face any energy problems and you can spam your fourth ability over and over again.

But what else can you do with Resonating Quake? Well, lots of stuff. With a range of 280%, Resonating Quake can actually hit all enemies around you in a radius of about 100 meters. Each shockwave may only hit each enemy once but it's more than enough to constantly knock down the entire map. Amazing crowd control and perfect for all type of missions where you don't necessarily have to kill enemies like a mobile defense for example.

## Banshee Resonating Quake Nuke Build

So, for the Banshee Resonating Quake Nuke Build you don't need any duration or energy mods anymore. This saves you two mod slots! You can now focus on a little bit more Strength but also on your casting speed.

And if you do have an Arcane Chorus Helmet, you could save another mod slot. Simply replace your Fleeting Expertise on rank 4 with one on rank 5 and remove Streamline. You can now add even more range or strength, it's up to you.

## Banshee Resonating Quake CC Build

For the Banshee Resonating Quake CC Build you can replace all of your strength mods with range mods. The other open mod slot/s can be used to increase your energy pool for example but you can basically use whatever you want.

Well, that's already it for today's article. I hope you enjoyed reading and I'll see you already in the next article!
