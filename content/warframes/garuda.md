description: Dubbed the “goreframe”, Garuda has a penchant for blood and gore, but she manages to couple this with a sense of grace and mystery. With her long limbs and lithe physique, she presents a quiet mystique – until you notice the large metal talons hanging off her arms as she pounces to attack… Given her abilities revolve around health and self-buff/debuff, she’s best used as a solo army or a solid standalone support frame.
