description: Inner peace and tranquility are the path to self-enlightenment – to harness and accept one’s self in entirety. Baruuk is one such enlightened soul, and with his release in Update 24.2, he brought with him a style of combat dedicated to spilling the least amount of blood as possible. But even the calmest of souls have a breaking point.
