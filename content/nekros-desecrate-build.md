Hey guys. Today we're gonna take a look at the Nekros. And I've been using the exact same build for well over a year now and I haven't been able to come up with anything better than this. It's the Nekros Desecrate Build that basically feeds itself through Equilibrium mod.<!--more-->

And here it is the Nekros Desecrate Build that's so good I haven't touched it in over a year and it's still really effective. The aura I'm using here is Corrosive Projection but you can swap it in whatever you want because Nekros Prime doesn't come with any aura polarity as standard. Then I'm using Health Conversion which is a mod that you can get from Cephalon Simaris on any of the relays. And what this does is it gives you 450 extra armor whenever you pick up a health orb and it stacks three times. But if you take damage it will consume one of the stacks after three seconds. Now, this doesn't work very well on a lot of frames but this build can very easily sustain all three stacks at all times giving you 1350 extra armor. And I've combined that with Vitality for a ton of effective health.

I'm then using Overextended, Cunning Drift, and Stretch for a stupid amount of range because I like to use this in all kinds of situations. So, I run it solo where a range isn't that big of a deal so you could drop one of the mods but I also run it in public squads where people are all over the place and the Plains of Eidolon where mobs are spread much farther apart.

Then I am running Equilibrium which is a mod that you don't see very often and what it does is it makes health orb also restore energy and energy orbs also restore health. And this pretty much gives you infinite energy throughout the entire mission because we are using Despoil which makes Desecrate cost health instead of mana. Now you have to remember the Desecrate has a very high chance of spawning a health orb so the way this build works is you turn on the Despoil you kill a bunch of dudes and you will Desecrate them which will drain your health but also spawn a bunch of health orbs. You will then run over these health orbs which will refill your health but also your energy, thanks to Equilibrium, and give you the armor bonus from Health Conversion as well. The cool thing about this is that as long as there are enemies for you to Desecrate which there will be in the vast majority of missions the cycle keeps repeating again and again and again giving you infinite energy and Valkyr levels of armor. And since I didn't want to cripple Shadows Of The Dead and Terrify too much I'm running Primed Continuity to balance out Fleeting Expertise which makes everything cheaper and it's mostly there for Despoil. So, it doesn't hurt as much but it's really nice to have for Shadows Of The Dead and Terrify as well.

Now, what you could do, if you don't mind having a less range which for public missions and Plains of Eidolon I kind of do, is you could take out Overextended and put in Augur Reach which would make your Nekros Terrify and Shadows Of The Dead abilities better. Though that's not to say that they are bad or even unusable on this build because they are very much not. Because while the stats on these abilities aren't as good as they would be on something like a pure creeping terrify build or Shadows Of The Dead build you can spam them all the time. You can keep your shadows alive throughout an entire bounty session. You can just spam Nekros Shadows Of The Dead over and over and over again and just take them through four or five bounties no problem. And when it comes to a terrifying same thing you can just spam it though, I tend to use it as more of an oh shit button when I get into a bad situation. And while that's going on you are still desecrating everything in a massive area.

I am so proud of this Nekros Build and the synergy is going on within it. No builds that I have comes anywhere near the awesomeness of this one. It's just so good. I don't play next anywhere near as much as I used to play back in the day mainly because I just have lots of resources so I don't really have to farm anything. But every now and then I will jump on Nekros and when I do I'm just like &#8220;Damn this build is so smooth it plays so well&#8221;. And that's pretty much it for the article. So, I thank you very much for reading. I hope you've enjoyed the article and it was helpful and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
