Hey guys and welcome to another [Warframe farming guide](/farming/ "Farming Resources in Warframe"). Today I'm gonna show you where you can get all three types of the different toroids that you need to either build Garuda or to gain standing with the Vox Solaris Syndicate in Warframe.<!--more-->

## Where to Get Toroids
So, there are three different Corpus bases in Orb Vallis and each enemy in these bases has a chance to drop a different toroid. At the top left corner of the map, we have the <b>Temple of Profit</b> where all enemies have a chance to drop the <strong>Sola Toroid</strong>.

Then kind of a left to [Fortuna](/fortuna/ "Warframe Fortuna") we have the <b>Enrichment Labs</b> where all enemies have a chance to drop <strong>Calda Toroid</strong>. And finally, at the bottom right corner of the map, we have the <b>Spaceport</b> where all enemies have a chance to drop a <strong>Vega Toroid</strong>. 

## How to Farm Toroids?
Now, the best way to farm toroids is to get a standard farming squad - at least one [Hydroid](/warframes/hydroid/) with [Pilfering Swarm](/hydroid-pilfering-swarm-build/ "Hydroid Pilfering Swarm Build") and at least one [Nekros](/warframes/nekros/ "Warframe Nekros") with [Despoil](/nekros-desecrate-build/ "Nekros Desecrate Build"). Also, I suggest you bring a Smeeta Kavat or use a resource booster for getting much more loot.  

Then go to the Corpus base, raise the alert level to maximum, and after that just kill enemies until you get all the toroids you need. Also, make sure you <b>don't destroy reinforcement beacons</b> because if you destroy them the alert level will go down and you will get fewer enemies. 

## Farming Toroids via Cave Runs
Toroids can also be found in certain parts of caves scattered around Orb Vallis. They work like [Ayatan Sculptures](/how-farm-endo/ "How To Get Endo in Warframe"), in that they must be manually picked up, instead of just walked over. Here is a handy map of the various caves that have the potential to yield toroids:

<img src='/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/warframe-caves-with-toroids.jpg' title='Warframe Farming Toroids via Cave Runs' alt='map of the caves that have the potential to yield toroids' width='750' height='265' class='alignnone size-large' srcset='/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/warframe-caves-with-toroids-1024x1027.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/12/warframe-caves-with-toroids-300x301.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/12/warframe-caves-with-toroids-768x770.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/12/warframe-caves-with-toroids.jpg 1460w' sizes='(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px'/>

Farming toroids in caves is a really great option. It does not require any good equipment, team composition or fighting against high-level enemies. In addition, the chance of getting toroids in a cave is pretty good and if you have an archwing you can easily travel from one cave to another to fast farm those toroids.

And that's pretty much all I want to say about toroids farming. I hope you've enjoyed the article and it was helpful. I wish you good luck when farming toroids and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
