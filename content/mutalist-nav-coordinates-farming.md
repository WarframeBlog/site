Hey guys and welcome to another Warframe article. And today we'll be farming the Mutalist Alad V Nav Coordinates which you can either use to craft the Mutalist Alad V Assassinate Key which takes three nav coordinates to build or you can trade them with other players for platinum because they're always in demand.<!--more-->

## Farm Mutalist Nav Coordinates In Orokin Derelict

{{< image title="Farming Mutalist Alad V Nav Coordinates in Orokin Derelict" alt="Orokin Derelict is the place where you can find Mutalist Alad V Nav Coordinates" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mutalist-nav-coordinates-orokin-derelict-1024x576.jpg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mutalist-nav-coordinates-orokin-derelict-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mutalist-nav-coordinates-orokin-derelict-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mutalist-nav-coordinates-orokin-derelict-768x432.jpg 768w">}}

And there are a few things you can do to obtain Mutalist Alad V Nav Coordinates. So, first of all, you can get them in Orokin Derelict Defense and Orokin Derelict Survival. And you're going to get them on rotation B in both missions. So, that's either after 15 minutes in survival or after 15 waves in defense. Now, while you can get them as a reward from rotation B there's also a possibility get another reward like [endo](https://warframeblog.com/how-farm-endo/). So don't be too mad if you don't get your Mutalist Alad V Nav Coordinates.

## Obtain Mutalist Alad V Nav Coordinates From Invasions

{{< image title="Warframe Mutalist Alad V Nav Coordinates from Invasions" alt="Infested invasions is a 100% chance to get Mutalist Alad V Nav Coordinates" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mutalist-nav-coordinates-invasions-1024x576.jpg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mutalist-nav-coordinates-invasions-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mutalist-nav-coordinates-invasions-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mutalist-nav-coordinates-invasions-768x432.jpg 768w">}}

Another way and actually the original way of obtaining the Mutalist Alad V Nav Coordinates is doing the infested invasions. If the infested invasion is high enough level the reward may be a Mutalist Nav Coordinates. And all you really have to do to get the Mutalist Nav Coordinates this way is just do the mission enough times to be eligible for the reward and then let other people deal with the infestation because these missions are usually very popular and are done incredibly fast. because there is a lot of people that want the Mutalist Alad V Nav Coordinates.

## FindÂ Mutalist Nav Coordinates In Hive Missions

{{< image title="Warframe get Mutalist Alad V Nav Coordinates" alt="Hive missions as a way to get Mutalist Alad V Nav Coordinates" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mutalist-nav-coordinates-hive-mission-1024x576.jpg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mutalist-nav-coordinates-hive-mission-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mutalist-nav-coordinates-hive-mission-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mutalist-nav-coordinates-hive-mission-768x432.jpg 768w">}}

And the third and final way of obtaining the Mutalist Alad V Nav Coordinates is by doing the Hive missions on Eris. But you need to find all three caches because the only third cache has a possibility to reward you with Mutalist Alad V Nav Coordinates. But it's only 4.51% chance which means it's actually a pretty bad way of farming the Mutalist Nav Coordinates.

So, the best thing you can do to farm the Mutalist Alad V Nav Coordinates is just keeping an eye out for the infested invasions that may have them as a battle pay reward. And while you're waiting for these missions to be done or you're waiting for another invasion to show up you can farm the Orokin Derelict Defense and Orokin Derelict Survival. And that's it for the Mutalist Alad V Nav Coordinates farming guide. So, I thank you very much for reading and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
