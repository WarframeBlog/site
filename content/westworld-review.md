## What is Westworld about?

Westworld tells the story of a theme park where guests can live out their darkest fantasies on the hosts in a Wild West settings. The hosts are robots but are almost indistinguishable from a human. Like most robot stories from the very first episode we get the notion that our robot servants are not as complacent or as submissive as we might hope. Or are they? Or aren&#8217;t they? Westworld brings together two genres science fiction and the Western. Mostly the two are separate with the occasional overlap and as the story progresses the overlap gets bigger. So, Westworld is a very ambitious show. Even though you basically have two locations the park and the corporate building. The park is vast and just like you have side quests on the video game you have all these little stories weaved into the general narrative.

## Westworld review

If you came to this article for simple yes or no, should I watch Westworld? Then yes. I think you should definitely watch it not because it&#8217;s going to be your favourite show ever because it actually might not be but the way the story is told is pretty special. A comment that I&#8217;ve heard about this show and I agree with is that even though the story seems big and a lot of money was thrown at this production ultimately the stories in this show are very personal. Westworld spends a lot of time exploring the idea of consciousness &#8211; what it means to have consciousness or does it even matter. The most powerful moments in this season are deeply personal moments where characters learn something about themselves and the world around them.

So, first let&#8217;s get some of the obvious things out of the way. First of all, the show looks absolutely amazing: the costumes, the sets, the cinematography. From a production value perspective, this is the incredibly high standard of quality you&#8217;ve come to expect from HBO. The performances in the show are fantastic all around again as you would expect but just like everybody else has been saying Anthony Hopkins plays one of the most compelling characters in the show, one of the most compelling characters I&#8217;ve seen lately.

Evan Rachel Wood who plays Dolores on the show said in an interview that Westworld is like the Acting Olympics. If that&#8217;s the case Anthony Hopkins got just all of the golds and Evan Rachel Wood got all of the silvers. She was amazing. The music in this show is spectacular, you need that soundtrack in your life. So much incredible talent went into this show. It&#8217;s so impressive. The story or stories in Westworld are familiar stories. They&#8217;re told in a unique way and some of them have a tasty twist but at their core, these are archetypes of stories that have been told before which sometimes is the point. I very much enjoyed Westworld and I&#8217;ll probably be watching it for as long as it&#8217;s gonna run but I went into it with the feeling that this is gonna be like one of my favourite shows ever. Some things about this show are my favourite things about good TV shows in general. But as I was watching it sometimes I felt like: &#8220;This is great. This is a very good show&#8221; but I should be feeling like this is the best thing ever and my mind is absolutely blown. I think that this was because of the contrast within the show. Some of this show is poetry inside this massive narrative there are deeply personal stories about complicated characters. Some of it might not feel very real like people typically aren&#8217;t poet philosophers but that part of the show is just so good so deep so compelling.

It made me think so much and somehow it made the rest of the show feel very standard. Some of the twists and turns and some of the signature J. J. Abrams mindfucks it was good but I felt that it didn&#8217;t have much impact. Sometimes when a show focuses on one aspect of storytelling it just becomes the best at that one thing. For example, Fringe another show that Abrams was involved in is a very different show you can&#8217;t really compare it with Westworld at all but I feel that Fringe is the best show of its style. It&#8217;s definitely my favourite Sci-Fi freak of the week mindfuck show.

Obviously, Westworld was taking on something much bigger but I felt that the contrast between the more introspective poetic philosophical parts of the show and pretty much everything else made me feel like I&#8217;m actually watching two different shows. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m making any sense. Also, it&#8217;s nitpicking. This is a great show and you should watch it.

## Should you watch Westworld?

Yes. Yes. Definitely. It&#8217;s one of the most impressive shows I&#8217;ve seen in a while. HBO knows how to do it and I am now invested in this show. So, go watch it.
