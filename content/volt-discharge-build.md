Hey guys and today we’re going to take a look at the Volt Discharge Build.<!--more-->

Besides Volt Discharge Build you might be interested in others [Volt builds](https://warframeblog.com/warframe-builds/). Well, if that is the case, you should definitely check out these two builds: the [Volt Speed Build](https://warframeblog.com/volt-speed-build/) and the Volt Eidolon Hunter Build.

Now, since the Volt Discharge Build is built mostly around Hydron, I'm using Corrosive Projection here as my aura to strip away the enemy armor because Discharge does electricity damage and that does 50% less versus alloy armor. Then since I don't have any efficiency I'm using Primed Flow so I can bank a ton of energy to cast Discharge. Then there is Primed Continuity and Augur Message for a decent amount of duration and this is because of the update 22.12.0 change when they made it so Discharge has a less duration the farther away the enemy is.

{{< image title="Warframe Volt Discharge Build" alt="Volt Discharge Build that I use" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/warframe-volt-discharge-build-1024x350.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/warframe-volt-discharge-build-1024x350.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/warframe-volt-discharge-build-300x103.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/warframe-volt-discharge-build-768x263.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/warframe-volt-discharge-build.png 1397w">}}

Next up is Augur Reach and Stretch which gives you a decent amount of range and this allows you to cover something like Hydron with a single cast. And I'm using the Capacitance augment which converts 3% of all the damage done by Discharge into shields and overshields for you and all your allies. This is also why I'm using Vitality to counter slash and toxin procs because you can easily generate shields with Capacitance. And to top it all off I'm using Transient Fortitude and Power Drift for some power strength which translates into more damage.

Now, this Volt Build will only really do damage on [Hydron](https://warframeblog.com/how-to-farm-relics/) and missions like Hydron because it relies on the enemies stacking close together to do damage. If the enemies are spread very far apart it will just crowd control them. But it's very strong. It will clear the majority of the tileset with the single cast and crowd control what's a left. It's also pretty beefy because you're always gonna be at maximum overshields.

Now, one thing you could do with this build which will turn it into a more spammy and bursty kind of thing is take out Primed Flow and put in a fully ranked Fleeting Expertise which will give you a ton of efficiency allowing you to spam Discharge far more often at the cost of a lot of duration.

And there really isn't much else to say about the Volt Discharge Build. It's pretty straightforward. You press a button everything dies and you and your allies get overshields. So, I thank you very much for reading. I hope you've enjoyed the article and it was helpful and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
