Hey guys and welcome to another Warframe farming guide. Today I want to talk a little bit about farming the new Jupiter resource - Hexenon. 

First of all, the frame I would recommend you farm this new resource would be Nekros with Desecrate Build on.

## Best Place to get Hexenon
So, what is the best place to farm Hexenon. Well, it is the Dark Sector Survival which in this case is Cameria. And the reason it's the best is because firstly we have a 20% resource drop rate booster which elevates above every other mission already and secondly it's an Infested mission rather than a Corpus mission. And the Infested generally make their way through the tileset a lot faster than the other faction which means you can kill them faster so they can respond faster resulting in higher kills per minute overall. And that is exactly what you want if you're farming something, you just want to roll that loot dice as often as possible.

This is actually a really good mission for farming other resources like Neural Sensors as well. This mission is not just good for Hexenon because even if you're solo which means you generally get fewer enemies than if you were in a four-man party where more enemies will spawn to accommodate more players, you'll be averaging somewhere between 200 and 250 killed enemies per five minutes. And it's quite a lot. It's kind of on the upper end of farming missions when it comes to kills per minute. 

Also, before you look at some of the numbers I would like to point out that I am running a resource booster so I'm getting double the resources.

## Farming Hexenon
So, at 5 minutes this was one of the good sort of average runs I had 238 enemies killed with 56 Hexenon. At around 10 minutes is usually where you will hit that 500 enemies mark I got 150 Hexenon. At 15 minutes things kind of slow down I had 680 kills and didn't get any Hexenon which kind of showcases how sporadic it can be. And finally, there is the 20 minute mark where I had 900 enemies killed and ended up with 186 Hexenon. But once again this is with a booster so in reality it's actually 93 if you're not running a booster.

Now, getting 100 Hexenon in 20 minutes might not sound like a lot but you have to bear in mind that it's nearly the worst case scenario. It's for people that like to play alone and just have Nekros and that's it. If you have just that if, you're playing alone and you're farming with Nekros you're gping to get about 100 per 20 minutes. 

However, if you bring three other people with you or you just jump into a random squad and you bring a weapon that does primarily slash damage so the enemies are cut into pieces and you can desecrate each piece separately, and also you bring Smeeta Kavat then you're gping to get a lot more Hexenon.

## Use extractor to get some Hexenon
Now, there is however something else you can do at the same time to get Hexenon. So, if you had over to the in-game market and you search for extractor you can pick up a distilling extractor blueprint which is reusable for 50,000 credits and while you're there pick up the Titan one as well why not you then want to head into your foundry and boots at extractor which will take 50,000 credits which you will make by simply playing missions as it's doing its thing 1,000 point bundles which is not too much and 150 oxen which you will get by farming Jupiter once the foundry finished building the extractor simply head over to Jupiter in your navigation and deploy the extractor and that's it 

now that you have an extractor on Jupiter you can check on it and collect free resources every four hours and since we chose the distilling extractor rather than they touch an extractor there is a hard chance it will have newer sensors and XE known 

Finally, one thing that's also definitely worth mentioning is that you can farm the ropal alloys which is an assassination mission on Jupiter it's the new boss fight but I would only do this if you're sick and tired of farming the survival and or if you still need some of the amalgam mods or wisp parts because all the unskipable cutscenesthat's nice when a 30 maybe 35 ish runs while I was farming the amalgam mods but no matter what you do it's gping to take like six minutes to complete because of all the unskipable cutscenesthat's anon when he kill it's just not worth it over the survival because it takes too long 

oh yeah and there's also this funky thing you can do in disruption because one of the beneficial things you can get from the terminals is a 50% resource booster and if you happen to not get this on the final terminal of the given around you can actually keep it around for about 15 minutes because if you get a beneficial effect from a terminal and in successfully defended it sticks around until you cycle through all the terminals in the given round at which point everything resets so what you can do if you want to and you get this resource booster before the round ends is just stop doing the disruption and farm this actually produces some solid numbers it is in my experience better than the darks it's a survival but there is a problem because there is a timer that starts counting down after about 15 minutes of you not doing any of the terminals so you unfortunately can't do this forever 

but anyway I think I've been rambling for long enough so I think you very much watching as always guys I hope you've enjoyed the article and it was helpful and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
