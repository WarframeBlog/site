Hello guys! Welcome to another Warframe farming guide and today I want to show you where and how to farm Orokin Cells.<!--more-->

Now, Orokin Cell similarly to Argon Crystals and [neurodes](https://warframeblog.com/warframe-neurodes-farming/) can be a pain to farm, especially with Orokin Cells that you need a lot of for all your Prime parts and whatnot. In this article, I'll be shown you several methods of farming orokin cells and also highlighting which are the best in my opinion. So, I do hope this helps you out and let's jump right into it.

So, you can get orokin cells at Saturn and Ceres. You can also get them in the Orokin Derelict. However, I've left out the Orokin Derelict as I don't feel it's the best use of time to farm orokin cells there.

## Where to farm Orokin Cells on Saturn?

So, let's start off with Saturn. First two missions I recommend are Cassini and Telesto which are capture and exterminate missions respectively. I highly recommend equipping the Master Thief mod for these missions as it gives you a chance at opening up locked lockers. These missions are recommended because the objective is usually very simple to complete and then you can spend the rest of the time opening up lockers and defeating other enemies. This is going to give you a much higher chance of getting more orokin cells than just relying on defeating enemies alone. So, with this strategy, you're going to come across many more cell arrays and these cell arrays drop one or two orokin cell each. So, an average these two missions are going to take you five to six minutes to complete and you should be getting anywhere between **one to three orokin cells per mission** completed.

So, the other mission is Tethys which is the assassination of general Sargas Ruk. It can be tedious for new players so I wouldn't recommend this. However, if you can reliably defeat the general Sargas Ruk then you're looking at **one orokin cell** on most runs. And you should be able to complete the mission within two and a half minutes.

## Where to get Orokin Cells on Ceres?

Now, let's move on to Ceres. The first mission I'll recommend is Lex - the capture mission. And the strategy is exactly the same as Cassini on Saturn open up as many containers and lockers as possible and defeat enemies along the way. You can do this solo or in a group. So, you're going to get the same results in this mission as you will get in the exterminate and capture missions on Saturn - **one to three orokin cells per run**.

So, let's move on to the best spot that's Gabii on Ceres a survival infestation mission which is also a dark sector giving you a 35% resource drop rate boost. Going with the team of four: one [Hydroid](https://warframeblog.com/how-to-get-hydroid/) on your team with [Pilfering Swarm](https://warframeblog.com/hydroid-pilfering-swarm-build/) augment mod equipped and you'll want one [Nekros](https://warframeblog.com/how-to-get-nekros/) on your team that has [Desecrate](https://warframeblog.com/nekros-desecrate-build/) on at all times. The strategy at Gabii is very simple. You want to find a dead end and you want Hydroid to do all the work with his fourth ability while Nekros supports with Desecrate. I'd also highly recommend having a speed Nova on your team so the enemies move faster and more come to you. So, you can defeat more of them and get more orokin cells. So, you should be getting anywhere between **6 to 12 orokin cells for 20 minutes**.

And now we move on to a mission which I do highly recommend. It's an assassination mission called Exta on Ceres and I recommend it simply because there are two bosses here which are pretty easy to beat and they both have a chance of dropping orokin cells. Bring a team with you to get it done quicker and you shouldn't be taking longer than three and a half minutes per run. So, it can prove to be a very good farm of orokin cells.

## Deploy Extractors to get Orokin Cells

So, aside from doing missions, you can also deploy extractors on Ceres and on Saturn. The Distilling Extractor gives you a higher chance to get orokin cells so I would recommend using that instead of the Titan. Also, you want to make sure you have extractions on both of these planets as frequently as you can.

## Orokin Cells from Alerts

Another way, of course, is to look for the alert missions which pop up from time to time. They usually can be completed pretty quickly and will give you one orokin cell.

## Orokin Cell Blueprint

You can also purchase the orokin cell blueprint to make one orokin cell per hour in your foundry but it's a waste of time.

And finally, don't forget you can always use resource boosters or resource drop chance boosters to get more orokin cells in lesser time. All right, thanks for reading. I do hope this helped you out. And I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
