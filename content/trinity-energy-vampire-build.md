Hey guys and today we're gonna check out Trinity EV Build which focuses on Energy Vampire ability and the Vampire Leech augment mod and it provides a lot of energy and over shields to your entire team and can also do some really nice burst healing with the Blessing.<!--more-->

So, I've had Trinity EV Build for a year at this point and it is very effective at what it does. The aura I'm using here is Corrosive Projection but you can use whatever you want, with kind of the exception of Energy Siphon. Because you're gonna be swimming in energy, thanks to Energy Vampire, so Energy Siphon is kind of pointless here.

Then to get some extra power strength to balance out Overextendeded and also kill duration I'm using Intensify and Transient Fortitude. And the reason why you want to kill duration on this EV Build is that Energy Vampire will always restore the same amount of energy but if you have a low duration it will restore it faster. Now, this isn't entirely necessary because you can also just kill the enemy that you have Energy Vampire on and will explode with energy giving you the full energy as well but if you're going up against high-level enemies that you can't one-shot this is actually really handy.

Then to reduce duration even further and get maximum efficiency I am running fully ranked Fleeting Expertise and Streamline. And this makes it so that you can spam Energy Vampire but also Blessing for some nice burst healing. Then we're gonna add Stretch, Cunning Drift, and Overextendeded so that our Energy Vampire has a lot of range and restores energy even to allies that are really far away from you or the enemy that you've targeted. I also went ahead and added Primed Vigor but you can use whatever defensive mod you want.

And we're gonna top it off with Vampire Leech which makes it so that if you or any of your allies have full energy and they get hit by Energy Vampires they get over shields instead.

## How does Trinity EV Build perform?

Now, there isn't much to say about the Trinity EV Build other than it is a fantastic support. The way that I play with this setup is whenever I load into a mission I will open up the party interface which on PC you do by pressing Z by default. So, you can see the energy health and shields of your party and I will pretty much just spam Energy Vampire throughout the entire mission to keep everyone topped off on energy and over shields with the occasional Blessing thrown in here and there for some healing when someone's health or shields dip down.

The Trinity EV Build is just awesome for endless missions. So, stuff like survival, defense, and interception. It's not amazing for defection because there you kinda want to use Blessing so I would probably switch over to [Trinity Blessing Build](https://warframeblog.com/trinity-blessing-build/).

So, that's pretty much it for Trinity EV Build. I thank you very much for reading. I hope you've enjoyed the article and it was helpful and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
