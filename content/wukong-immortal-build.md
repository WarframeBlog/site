Hey guys and today we're gonna take a look at Wukong Immortal Build. This build is fantastic for a very tricky mission, tough sorties, and generally, missions that would straight-up destroy other warframes.<!--more-->

So, for Wukong Immortal Build I'm using Steel Charge as its aura which increases the damage of both are Iron Jab and Primal Fury and it gives you a ton of mod capacity. I also slap in Power Drift into the exilus slot which increases the damage of Iron Jab and Primal Fury a little bit. Though it's not necessary so you can run something like Rush for faster sprint speed, Thief's Wit for more loot radar, Handspring for faster knockdown recovery or just not use an exilus slot at all.

Then I wanted a ton of duration so I have Primed Continuity, Narrow Minded, and Constitution. This makes the invulnerability buff from Defy last longer and it also reduces the drain on both the Defy and Primal Fury which is followed up by Streamline which reduces the drain even further. And it also makes Iron Jab cheaper.

Then there is Hunter Adrenaline which is very important because it converts 45% of all the damage done to your health into energy which then gets stored thanks to Primed Flow. This is what enables the Defy cycle because you will take damage to your health which will be converted into energy and stored thanks to Primed Flow and then use by Defy to heal you up and provide invulnerability. And it just repeats over and over and over again until you run out of health because every time Defy procs it will heal you for a little bit less to a point where eventually you won't have enough health to take enough damage to generate enough energy to proc Defy and you will die.

This, however, can very easily be bypassed by simply deactivating and reactivating Defy which will reset the whole cycle. This also why I am running Steel Fiber and Vitality so that I don't instantly get knocked into Defy every time it runs out. So it kind of elongates the whole cycle.

## Melee Build ForÂ Wukong Immortal Build

That's not the full Wukong Immortal Build however because both Iron Jab and Primal Fury are affected by some mods on your [melee weapon](https://warframeblog.com/melee-weapons/) but not the stats on your melee weapon so you can put this on whatever you want.

So, it's affected by generic melee damage so we have Primed Pressure Point and attack speed so we have Primed Fury though you don't want to add too much attack speed which is why I'm running Spoiled Strike for some extra damage. And it's because if you add too much attack speed the combos on Primal Fury will just break and it will feel pretty bad because the combos will just stop halfway through if you can't click fast enough which you really can't. Primal Fury also has 25% base crit so we have True Steel for crit chance and Organ Shatter for crit damage. And then you can either run three 90% elementals for damage or three dual stat mods for status.

## Wukong Immortal Build Arcanes

There are many things you can do with [arcanes](https://warframeblog.com/eidolons-drop-arcane-enhancements/) here. I would recommend are either Arcane Energize for higher energy sustain because it gives you a chance to get 100 extra energy when you pick up an energy orb. And if you want to focus more on Primal Fury I would go for [Arcane Strike](https://warframeblog.com/top-arcanes-to-boost-your-damage/) and Arcane Fury which will give you more attack speed and melee damage respectively.

Now, this Wukong Build wasn't specifically designed to run both Primal Fury and Defy at the same time. I'm also designed it for Defy so I can run around with a primary or a secondary weapon and use Primal Fury every now and then. This makes sortie assassination super easy assuming that you don't run into like a nullifier bubble. You can also just go with Primal Fury though this only really works in a lower level mission so where the enemy damage isn't too bad or you can just put on both and be immortal though this does make energy sustain a little bit harder.

And it's pretty much it for the Wukong Immortal Build. Now, if you're not quite sure how to forma it the best way to do it, in my opinion, is to simply put in all the mods and if they don't fit look for the one with the highest capacity drain that shares between all your [builds](https://warframeblog.com/warframe-builds/) forma for that and do that until all the mods fit. And I thank you very much for reading. I hope you have enjoyed the article. And I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
