Hey guys and welcome to another Warframe news article. Today I want to talk a little bit about the Rhino and Nyx Prime unvaulting that happened 24th of July. <!--more--> 

So, this time around we have five packs in total. The first one is the Brains and Brawn Dual Prime Pack. 
This will cost you 60 bucks and it has:

* 1200 [Platinum](/ways-earn-platinum/ "Ways to Earn Platinum") 
* Nyx Prime 
* Rhino Prime 
* Boltor Prime 
* Hikou Prime 
* Ankyros Prime 
* Scindo Prime 
* Targis Prime Armor Set 
* Noru Prime Syandana 
* Vala Sugatra Prime 
* Distilling Extractor Prime + Blueprint 
* Prime Glyphs

It's basically all in one pack if you don't have anything. 

Now this is then split in half with the Nyx Prime Pack and Brute Prime Pack. So, for Nyx Prime Pack costs 40 bucks and has:

* 400 [Platinum](/how-earn-platinum-vault-runs/ "How to earn Platinum | Vault Runs") 
* Nyx Prime 
* Hikou Prime 
* Scindo Prime 
* Targis Prime Armor Set 
* Vala Sugatra Prime 
* Prime Glyphs/Profile Icons

And the Brute Prime Pack which is also 40 bucks and this one has: 

* 400 Platinum 
* Rhino Prime 
* Boltor Prime 
* Ankyros Prime 
* Distilling Extractor Prime + BP 
* Noru Prime Syandana 
* Prime Glyphs/Profile Icons

However, this time around they also added two more packs there is the Nyx Prime Accessory Pack which is 20 bucks and has: 

* 200 Platinum 
* Targis Prime Armor Set 
* Vala Sugatra Prime

And the [Rhino](/rhino-iron-skin-build/ "Rhino Iron Skin Build") Prime Accessory Pack which is also 20 bucks and has:

* 200 Platinum 
* Noru Prime Syandana 
* Distilling Extractor Prime + Blueprint

Some people think that the Prime Accessory Packs are too expensive but I really don't think so. I mean this is the first time around we can actually buy them separately because previously you would either have to buy them with a $40 pack or the $60 pack regardless of whether you had the frame or not. 

Now, you of course don't have to buy these you can if you want to but DE also added their [relics](/how-to-farm-relics/ "How To Farm Relics - Lith, Meso, Neo & Axi") back into the rotation. So, you can farm everything if you want to with the exception of the prime accessories of course. 

So, four relics were added Lith B4, Meso N6, Neo R1, and Axi S3 and these are all Void exclusive. So, rather than farming them all over the Star Chart they drop in certain missions in the Void as sort of a callback to the old Void System. I think it's pretty cool. I like it. 

## Which relics drop which parts?
And here is new relics and which parts they drop:

## Relics drop locations
<img src='/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nyx-rhino-prime-relics-drop-locations.jpg' title='Relics drop locations for Nyx Prime and Rhino Prime' alt='Warframe Unvaulted Relics drop locations' width='750' height='265' class='alignnone size-large' srcset='/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nyx-rhino-prime-relics-drop-locations-1024x493.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nyx-rhino-prime-relics-drop-locations-300x144.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nyx-rhino-prime-relics-drop-locations-768x369.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nyx-rhino-prime-relics-drop-locations.jpg 1430w' sizes='(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px'/>
Now, since it only drops in the Void here is the drop locations for each relic. 

So, if you want to **farm Lith B4** you want to do <b>Ani, Hepit, Stribog, Tarnis, Teshub, and Tiwaz</b>. 

If you want to **farm Meso N6** you want to do <b>Ani, Belenus, Oxomoco, Stribog, Taranis, Tiwaz, and Ukko</b>.

If you want to **farm Neo R1** you want to do <b>Ani, Aten, Belenus, Marduk, Mithra, Mot, Oxomoco, and Ukko</b>. 

And finally, if you want to **farm Axi S3** you want to do <b>Aten, Belenus, Marduk Mithra, and Mot</b>.

And that's pretty much all there is to say about that with the exception that I would probably focus on Boltor Prime even though all the items are worth farming Boltor Prime is just a really strong rifle. So, if you don't have an awful lot of time and you want to focus on something I would probably pick the Boltor if I were you. So, that's pretty much it for the article. I thank you very much for reading. I hope you've enjoyed it and it was helpful and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
