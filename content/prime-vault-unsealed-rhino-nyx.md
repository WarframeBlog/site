Hey guys and welcome to another Warframe news article. Today I want to talk a little bit about Prime Vault because it will reopen once again on the 24th of July. <!--more-->

Now, we already knew what the frames are going to be thanks to Tennocon. So, it's Rhino Prime with his weapons and Nyx Prime with her weapons. But there is something special this time around because we will finally be able to buy the accessory separately. We won't have to buy the frames that we may or may not have already just to get the accessories which is amazing. This is something that we've been asking for. 

Now, there is of course the full pack where you will get everything as well as 1200 [platinum](/how-earn-platinum-vault-runs/ "How to earn Platinum | Vault Runs").

## Individual packs
### Nyx Prime Pack
Moving on to the individual packs. So, for Nyx you're gonna get 400 [platinum](/ways-earn-platinum/ "Ways to Earn Platinum"), Nyx Prime Hikou Prime, Scindo Prime, Targis Prime Armor Set, Vala Sugatra Prime and the respective Primed glyphs and profile icons. 

### Rhino Prime Pack
And for [Rhino](/rhino-iron-skin-build/ "Rhino Iron Skin Build") you're also gonna get 400 platinum, Rhino Prime Boltor Prime, Ankyros Prime, Distilling Extractor Prime + BP, Noru Prime Syandana and once again the glyphs and profile icons. 

## Accessory Packs
### Nyx Prime Accessory Pack
And then there are the Accessory Packs. And I think they said these will cost 20 bucks. So, for the Nyx Prime Accessory Pack 
you're gonna get 200 platinum, Targis Prime Armor Set, and the Vala Sugatra Prime. 

### Rhino Prime Accessory Pack
And for the Rhino Prime Accessory Pack you're also gonna get 200 platinum, Noru Prime Syandana, and Distilling Extractor Prime + Blueprint.

Now, the opening of the Prime Vault is as usual a little bit staggered. So, North and South America is gonna get it on the 24th of July, Europe and Asia is gonna get it on the 25th of July, and finally Japan is gonna get it on the 26th of July. 

Now you of course don't have to buy these packs to get the frames or the weapons because as soon as the Prime Vault opens they were also reintroduce new [relics](/how-to-farm-relics/ "How To Farm Relics - Lith, Meso, Neo & Axi") into the game that will drop Rhino Prime, Nyx Prime, and their respective weapons. 

But if you don't want to farm them and you just want to buy them right away the prices should be $60 for the full pack where you get everything, $40 for the individual packs and as I've said already about 20 bucks for the Accessory Packs. 

And that is pretty much it for the article. Later on, as new relics will be introduced, I definitely update this article. So, if you are going to farm new relics I suggest you to bookmark this page. And I thank you very much for reading. I hope you've enjoyed the article and I'll see you next time. Bye-bye.
