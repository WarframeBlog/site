Hey guys and today we’re gonna check out Volt Speed Build.<!--more-->

<span>Now, for Volt Speed Build, I decided to go with</span> Sprint Boost as its aura for a little bit of extra sprint speed which is unfortunately not reflected on the stats screen. I also added Rush in the exilus slot for even more sprint speed. Then I have Augur Message, Primed Continuity, and Narrow Minded for a ton of duration so speed lasts a decent amount of time. Intensify and Transient Fortitude for some power strength so the speed buff is stronger and we can run around faster. And I like to have one defensive mod and I generally go for Vitality because of slash and toxin procs.

Then there is the augment for speed called Shocking Speed which makes it so that if you have speed active you shock nearby enemies for a small amount of electricity damage and you proc electricity on them. This will one-shot low-level enemies and crowd control high-level enemies. Also, it will break certain containers. So, it makes the whole Volt Build more convenient and much safer. It's also not affected by power range which is why we can safely run Narrow Minded here. And to top it all off I'm using Streamline to get some efficiency without sacrificing duration with something like Fleeting Expertise.

Now, this is definitely not the fastest speed build you can add a lot more speed if you can manage it. But I found that this is about as much speed as I can manage especially since I like to use this with melee weapons. Also if you have too much speed stairs and ramps become a problem because if you're not looking straight down as you're running down the stairs or the ramps you will start doing slam attacks.

The Volt Speed Build is also the reason why I don't very often use the Nezha Fire Walker Build. And it's because Volt Speed Build just feels a lot better and Nezha just gets too slippery at higher speeds.

Now, one reason why you might not want to go for too much speed and you might even go for less speed is doors. Doors in normal missions weren't really made with this much speed in mind. So, if you're going really fast they won't open fast enough and you will keep slamming into them over and over and over again.

When it comes to the [Plains of Eidolon](https://warframeblog.com/get-started-plains-of-eidolon/), there are no doors so you can go as fast as you can which is a lot of fun. And I still use this to [farm Cetus Wisps](https://warframeblog.com/farm-cetus-wisp/) even though the Nova Wormhole Build is far faster. It's just so more fun to run around like a madman then to teleport from pond to pond.

So, that’s pretty much it for Volt Speed Build. I thank you very much for reading. I hope you’ve enjoyed the article and it was helpful and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
