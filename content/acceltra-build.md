Hey guys and today we are going to take a quick look at Gauss's signature fully automatic rocket launcher - Acceltra.<!--more-->

## How to get Acceltra?
So, how do you get this weapon? Well, if you actually go to the market page for this weapon, it tells you that Blueprint for the Acceltra drops from the Demolisher Infestation on Grineer Galleons in Disruption missions. Now, the mission it's referring to is the <b>Infested Disruption mission UR on Uranus</b>. And the Demolisher Infestated are the big infested that comes in once per terminal and try to destroy it. They supposedly, according to the wiki at least, have 2.50% chance to drop the blueprint. 

## Acceltra Characteristics
Now, the Acceltra, once you get it, requires mastery rank eight, it has really good crit stats with 32% crit chance, 2.8x crit multiplier, really fast fire rate, almost no status chance whatsoever. It does primarily puncture followed by impact and just a little bit of slash. 

Now, don't get the **Acceltra** to fool you. It is not an assault rifle, it is a rocket launcher in disguise. It's kind of like a rifle but it fires small rockets that detonate on impact. And the rockets do self damage but it doesn't really matter because of the way the weapon works. 

So, at first glance the weapon works exactly as you would expect, you press the fire button, you get a boom from the rocket. However, the way the rockets work is that they have to fly seven meters from the barrel in order for them to arm. If they don't travel those seven meters they will still do their damage but they won't explode which makes it really hard though not impossible to actually get hit by the self damage. So, is the first cool thing and yes there is more than one. 

The second thing has to do with reloading. At base the Acceltra has a two second reload. However, if you press the reload while sprinting it will reload much faster. And even cooler than that it doesn't just reduce the time it takes to reload, it accelerates the reload so you can start sprinting at any point during the reload and you will still accelerate it.

Now, all you need to do for this Acceltra Build is just add two V's. So, the mods I have here are Serration for the damage, Split Chamber for multishot, Point Strike for critical chance, Vital Sense for critical damage, and then I went with Vigilante Armaments for even more multishot. And then I have Thermite Rounds for the heat and status and Malignant Force combined with High Voltage for corrosive and status, though this will be changed into gas and electricity if I'm fighting the Corpus or low-level Infested. 

Now, there is one thing about the Acceltra that's a little bit iffy and that's the ammo reserve. It does not have a lot of ammo. You have about three magazines worth of ammo and once you chew through that that's it. And with the weapon that fires this fast, you can chew through them very quickly. However, at the same time it's also rifle ammo which is very plentiful and restores a lot of ammo per pickup. So, it shouldn't be a problem. But if that's a problem for you just take out Vigilante Armaments and put in Vigilante Supplies instead which still has the over crit bonus from the set but it provides ammo mutation instead of multishot. 

And that is pretty much it for the weapon. The Acceltra is just awesome. I would recommend it to anyone. It's definitely worth the grind for the blueprint. It's just amazing. And as always, I thank you very much for reading. I hope you've enjoyed the article and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
