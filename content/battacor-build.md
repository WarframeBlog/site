Hey guys and welcome to another [Warframe Build](/builds/ "Warframe Builds") article. Today I want to take a quick look at one of the new weapons that arrived with [Fortuna](/fortuna/ "Warframe Fortuna") the Battacor. <!--more-->

## Battacor Manufacturing Requirements
Now, first things first, you get the blueprint for the Battacor from the Corpus Lab in your Dojo. The blueprint will cost you 15,000 credits. Then to build the Battacor you have to put an additional 25,000 credits, 10 Fieldrons, 40 Tepa Nodule, 25 Heart Noctrul, and 20 Entroplasma.

## Battacor Stats
The Battacor is a mastery rank 10 burst rifle that fires two rounds with each shot and does 132 damage per burst. So, 66 damage per bullet: 42 of which is magnetic and 24 is a puncture. It can fire up to 3.57 rounds per second with really good accuracy. Also, it has a decent reload speed of two seconds. It also has a very high crit chance of 32%, above average crit multiplier of 2.4x, and a pretty decent status chance of 18%. 

## Battacor Unique Fire Mechanic
The Battacor also comes with the unique fire mechanic where whenever you kill an enemy you will gain a charge which can be discharged with a secondary fire button and you can see the number of charges you have by how many bars have turned white on the right side of your crosshairs. 

And the discharge is basically the same as a normal shot from the Opticor. And it does 208 radiation damage per charge. In addition, it has slightly different stats than the primary fire. So, it has a 34% crit chance, 3x crit multiplier, and 8% status chance. Also, using the secondary fire will always consume all the charges. You can't just fire them off one at a time. 

Now, both of the Battacor Builds require 3 forma where you need to add 3 V's.
## Battacor Build

So, versus Grineer and Infested I'm running Serration for damage, Split Chamber for multishot, Point Strike and Argon Scope for crit chance. Then Vital Sense for crit damage, Thermite Rounds for heat damage and status chance. And finally, Malignant Force and High Voltage for corrosive. 

## Battacor Corpus Build 
{{< image title="Warframe Battacor Corpus Build" alt="Battacor Corpus Build" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/warframe-battacor-corpus-build.jpg" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/warframe-battacor-corpus-build-1024x364.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/12/warframe-battacor-corpus-build-300x107.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/12/warframe-battacor-corpus-build-768x273.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/12/warframe-battacor-corpus-build.jpg 1539w">}}
And for the Battacor Corpus Build, I ended up with Malignant Force and Thermite Rounds for status chance and gas damage. And finally, Bane of Corpus which takes all the damage you're doing and multiplies it by 30%. Also if you really want to juice this up versus the Corpus you could go with a Primed version of this mod instead. Though that will require one more forma. 

Now, the weapon does kind of struggle when it comes to the Grineer and it's a combination of them just having a lot of armor especially at high levels but also the weapon doing mostly magnetic damage would isn't that great versus the Grineer. But it's not completely terrible especially in a normal mission where you have weaker units that you can easily take out with the primary fire and focus on the bigger units with the secondary fire. It performs a little bit better versus the Invested especially if you once again use the primary fire on the smaller units and the secondary fire versus the heavier units. 

But if you primarily want to use the Battacor versus the Grineer or the Infested I would actually recommend you drop the hybrid build and go with a full crit build that uses 90 percent elemental mods instead. The reason I didn't do that is well because it's Fortuna time so the majority of the enemies that I'm gonna be fighting nowadays are the Corpus and the Battacor Corpus Build deals with them really well. 

In conclusion, the Battacor is a decently powerful and very unique primary burst rifle that's a ton of fun to use. And I would highly recommend you check it out. And it's pretty much all I wanted to say. So, I thank you very much for reading. I hope you've enjoyed the Battacor Build article and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
