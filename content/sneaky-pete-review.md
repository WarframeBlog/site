Hello everyone! Let&#8217;s talk about season one of the Amazon Original Sneaky Pete.<!--more-->

## What is Sneaky Pete about?

Sneaky Pete tells the story of Marius Josipovic &#8211; a con man, who after spending a few years in prison assumes the identity and life of another man in order to try and lay low and escape from the bad guys he owes money to. Marius ends up on a farm and gets caught up in a complicated family dynamic with a family that isn&#8217;t really his while he also has to deal with his own problems like being out on parole, owing money to gangsters, being on the run from gangsters, and issues with his own real family.

Marius is a con man or a con artist so the way he deals with his problems is by lying outsmarting people and basically conning everybody around him until he gets what he wants. He just has so many things going on that something has to go wrong at some point and obviously lots of things go wrong. This show is equal parts crime, drama, and family drama and it does both of these things very well. Marius lands in the middle of this already complicated family just as things are becoming even more complicated. The story with this family seems like it would have been interesting enough for a TV show as is. So, I had a lot of fun thinking about what would have happened if Marius didn&#8217;t show up. The ripple effect that him showing up had on this family was pretty fascinating. On the other side, you have the crime boss Marius owes money to. It&#8217;s also an interesting story in itself. I loved watching how these two worlds affect each other.

## Sneaky Pete review

So, the first things I wanted to talk about are the performances and the characters. Giovanni Ribisi and Bryan Cranston as Marius and Vince are phenomenal in this show. Obviously, Bryan Cranston has proven many times that he&#8217;s an incredibly good actor and even specifically as a crime boss but Vince has a very different personality from what I&#8217;m used to seeing in a Cranston&#8217;s characters. So, at first it felt a little weird but once I got used to him in this role it&#8217;s another Cranston. Marius character was fascinating. You&#8217;ve seen this character before the super-smart con man but Marius doesn&#8217;t feel like just a template character. The show takes the time to flush him out and Ribisi just does a fantastic job with the character. The grandparents I also thought were just really good characters. Actress Margo Martindale exquisite as always. The pacing of this show was great. There really isn&#8217;t a lot of downtimes. Things move. Things happen in every episode. There&#8217;s no filler. It&#8217;s ten episodes and it feels like it should be ten episodes. I think that&#8217;s an incredibly hard thing to nail.

I love this show. I had a lot of fun with it. The characters were developed and deep. There are multiple interesting stories but it never feels like too much and it&#8217;s fun watching how everything connects. If I had to point out anything that I didn&#8217;t like as much, I&#8217;d say that there are a few times where they get a little too Ocean&#8217;s Eleven. It kind of breaks the overall tone of the show just a little bit and because some of the performances in this show are so good the ones that aren&#8217;t kind of stick out. These are incredibly minor issues tho&#8217;.

## Should you watch Sneaky Pete?

Yes! I definitely recommend it. Sneaky Pete pretty much nails every aspect of the story: the drama, the crime, the personal relationship. It even manages to be fun and have fun and be funny some of the time without making the dramatic and somber moments any less meaningful. There are some great performances in this show. Pretty much all the characters are well-developed and interesting and it doesn&#8217;t drag. It&#8217;s just as long as it needs to be. Season one of Sneaky Pete is available on Amazon Video Prime.
