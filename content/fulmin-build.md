Hey guys and welcome to another Warframe build article. Today we're going to take a quick look at Wisp's signature primary rifle **the Fulmin** which is both a shotgun as well as a fully automatic rifle. <!--more-->

## Fulmin Manufacturing Requirements
Now, first things first, you can get the blueprint for the Fulmin from the market for 20,000 credits and then to build a weapon you have to pry additional 25,000 credits, 2,100 rubedo, 7,500 Nano Spores, 2 Argon Crystals, and 350 pieces of the new resource Hexenon. 

## Fulmin Fire Modes
Now, the Fulmin requires to be at least mastery rank eight to use it and as I said already it is both a shotgun as well as a fully automatic rifle. 

The shotgun mode or semi-auto mode does 500 damage per shot. 400 out of which is electricity and 100 is impact with 30% crit chance, 2.2x crit multiplier, and 16% status chance. This mode fires sort of an Arca Plasmor's projectile that is pierced through all enemies but it only has a range of about 20 meters. 

Also, while the weapon is in the semi-automatic mode it is completely silent and it has a fire rate of 2.17. 

If you press the secondary fire button though it will switch into full-auto mode at which point the weapon will start doing 33 damage per shot. 25 out of which is electricity and 8 is puncture. 

It will also shuffle the secondary stats around a little bit. So, the critical chance will go down to 28%, the critical multiplier will go up to 2.4x, and the status chance will go down to 10%. The weapon is also no longer silent in this mode and it gains a substantial amount of fire rate since it goes fully-auto so that goes up to 9.33. 

Now, switching between the two fire modes looks absolutely fantastic. It's not just a click that you hear like it's with most other weapons. There is actually an animation that plays and your warframe will hold the weapon differently as well. 

Now, the Fulmin also has a 60 rounds magazine regardless of its mode. It uses a charge based system for it's ammo where recharge starting after one second of you not firing the weapon. The one thing to bear in mind here is that while the full auto mode will drain one round per shot and the semi-auto mode will drain 10 rounds per shot. And finally, the Fulmin does not come with any polarities to begin with.

## Fulmin Hybrid Build
The Build I ended up using on the Fulmin requires three forma where you add three V's and it's just straight up Hybrid Build with Argon Scope.

{{< image title=\"Warframe Fulmin Build\" alt=\"Fulmin 3 Forma Build\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fulmin-3-forma-build.jpg\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fulmin-3-forma-build.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fulmin-3-forma-build-768.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fulmin-3-forma-build-640.jpg 640w\" >}}

So, the mods that we have here are Serration for damage, Split Chamber for multishot, Point Strike and Argon Scope for critical chance followed by Vital Sense for critical damage. Then we have Thermite Rounds for heat damage and status chance. And we top it all off with Malignant Force and High Voltage for corrosive and status chance. 

This Fulmin Build is relatively cheap and it will get the job done. It is very strong so it will take you through the entire game including sorties no problem. It also works really well for both fire modes. It has just enough behind the semi-auto shotgun mode to take care of the vast majority of enemies and take down even the toughest enemies within a couple of shots. 

All in all, the Fulmin is great. It doesn't have any real downside like a terrible reload speed or small magazine or horrible accuracy. Thus, I would highly recommend you check this weapon out. And that is pretty much all I wanted to say. So, I thank you very much for reading. I hope you've enjoyed the Fulmin Build article and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
