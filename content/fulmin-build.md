Hey guys and welcome to another Warframe build article. Today we're going to take a quick look at Wisp's signature primary rifle **the Fulmin** which is both a shotgun as well as a fully automatic rifle. <!--more-->

Now, first things first, you can get the blueprint for the Fulmin from the market for 20,000 credits and then to build a weapon you have to pry additional 25,000 credits, 2,100 rubedo, 7,500 Nano Spores, 2 Argon Crystals, and 350 pieces of the new resource Hexenon. 

Now, the Fulmin requires to be at least mastery rank eight to use it and as I said already it is both a shotgun as well as a fully automatic rifle. 

The shotgun mode or semi-auto mode does 500 damage per shot. 400 out of which is electricity and 100 is impact with 30% crit chance, 2.2x crit multiplier, and 16% status chance. This mode fires sort of an Arca Plasmor's projectile that is pierced through all enemies but it only has a range of about 20 meters. 

Also, while the weapon is in the semi-automatic mode it is completely silent and it has a fire rate of 2.17. 

If you press the secondary fire button though it will switch into full-auto mode at which point the weapon will start doing 33 damage per shot. 25 out of which is electricity and 8 is puncture. 

It will also shuffle the secondary stats around a little bit. So, the critical chance will go down to 28%, the critical multiplier will go up to 2.4x, and the status chance will go down to 10%. The weapon is also no longer silent in this mode and it gains a substantial amount of fire rate since it goes fully-auto so that goes up to 9.33. 

Now, switching between the two fire modes looks absolutely fantastic. It's not just a click that you hear like it's with most other weapons. There is actually an animation that plays and your warframe will hold the weapon differently as well. 

Now, the Fulmin also has a 60 rounds magazine regardless of its mode. It uses a charge based system for it's ammo where recharge starting after one second of you not firing the weapon. The one thing to bear in mind here is that while the full auto mode will drain one round per shot and the semi-auto mode will drain 10 rounds per shot. And finally, the Fulmin does not come with any polarities to begin with.

The Build I ended up using on the Fulmin requires three forma where you add three V's and it's just straight up Hybrid Build with Argon Scope.

So, the mods that we have here are Serration for damage, Split Chamber for multi shot point strike and Argon Scope crit chance followed by 2 cents for crit damage then we after my transfer he damaged his latest chance and we top it all off with malignant force and high voltage for corrosive and status chance though of course there are alternatives like for example if you don't have argon scope you can easily substitute it with hammer shot for a little bit of crit and status or if you want to focus more on the full auto side of things you can even go with a hunter munitions viral build something like this or you can just put in Prime thread instead of argon scopes where you can strip away armor through corrosive much faster or and even though I would highly recommend you not to run this build even go with just a form crit build where you put on 90% elementals and Primed crowned which will give you a lot more umph but it's not going to scale as well as the other builds into a late-game I chose the build that I did because it's relatively cheap and it will get the job done it is very strong so it will take you through the entire game including sorties no problem it also works really well for both fire mods it is just enough behind the semi-auto shotgun mode to take care of the vast majority of enemies and take down even the toughest enemies within a couple of shots and hybrid setups in general are just great for fully automatic rifles so when there is either a ton of smaller enemies or enemies that don't have enough lot of armor like the infested for example I can just use the semi-auto mod and absolutely destroy them but when I run into something like a heavy gunner or a bombard I can quickly switch into semi-auto mod and shred them very fast and what I like about it the mouse is that I get to choose which one I use based on the situation I mean if for example I find you in the Grenier and a really juicy bombard shows up I'm just going to switch into full auto and shred him really quickly but if I'm fighting the corpus and a corpus stick shows up which is kind of like the equivalent of a bombard for the corpus I would rather be in the semi-auto because of the burst and now we come to the conclusion so what do I actually think about the foeman well honestly I think it's great though there is one thing that kind of annoys me about it sometimes and it has to do with the recharge because again sometimes really screw you over especially in the new disruption mod where if you're not careful you can sometimes find off your magazine and then not have enough ammo for the Demel a store when he comes to break your terminal and you just lose the defense point but that has less to do with the charge mechanic and more to do with me just being adder because charge mechanics are great it means you don't have to worry about ammo economy and you can just run with them forever and ever because you can never out of ammo though now that I'm thinking about it again I would probably like the semi-auto mod to have a little bit more range just a little bit because as it is right now a lot of the rooms that you get yourself into especially some of the bigger rooms like we have on Jupiter now are just too big for the semi-auto mod and you just won't be able to hit enemies on the other side of it but once again this probably has more to do with me being a derp and generally light in the semi-auto mod a lot more than the full auto mod then the weapon being bad so all in all the weapon doesn't really have a hard down side you know like a terrible reload speed or small magazine or horrible accuracy the small annoyance is that the weapon comes with can be played around and basically nullified by being good so I would highly recommend you check this weapon out it is not that expensive once you farm a little bit of the new Jupiter town site and you get yourself the new resource it's strong and it feels awesome and that is pretty much all I wanted to say. So, I thank you very much for reading. I hope you've enjoyed the article and I will see you next time. bye-bye
