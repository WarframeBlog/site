Hey guys and welcome to another Weapon Build article. Today we're gonna take a quick look at the Vasto Prime.<!--more-->

Now, the unfortunate thing here is that all the relics for Vasto Prime are currently vaulted but the full set isn't that expensive. I quickly browse the warframe market and it seems to be around 60 [Platinum](https://warframeblog.com/ways-earn-platinum/) on PS4 and about 100 [Platinum](https://warframeblog.com/how-earn-platinum-vault-runs/) on both PC and Xbox One.

I'm still gonna go through the drop locations though because you might just buy the [relics](https://warframeblog.com/how-to-farm-relics/) because I'm pretty sure I have a couple of them and you might even have a couple of them as well. So, the blueprint is an uncommon drop from Neo S3 relic, the barrel is a common drop from the Neo D1, Neo N2, and Axi V3 relics, and the receiver is a common drop from the Lith A1 and Meso V2 relics. So, the Vasto Prime should be pretty easy to get assuming you have all the relics.

Now, the Vasto Prime is a semi-automatic secondary pistol that requires you to be at least mastery rank 10 to use it. And it does 66 damage with each shot: 46.2 is slash and 9.9 is both puncture and impact. It fires up to 5.4 rounds every second with six rounds in the magazine, 210 rounds in total. It has a very fast reload of one second. It has pretty solid crit and status chance both at 22% in an above-average 2.4x crit multiplier. The weapon is also pinpoint-accurate which is really nice and it comes with two V polarities which is fantastic.

## Vasto Prime Build

When it comes to the build on the Vasto Prime I'm using a two forma build where I've added two V's. And it's a hybrid viral slash build.

{{< image title="Warframe Vasto Prime Build" alt="Vasto Prime 2 Forma Build that I use" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/warframe-vasto-prime-2-forma-build-1024x361.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/warframe-vasto-prime-2-forma-build-1024x361.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/05/warframe-vasto-prime-2-forma-build-300x106.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/05/warframe-vasto-prime-2-forma-build-768x271.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/05/warframe-vasto-prime-2-forma-build.png 1548w">}}

So, the mods I'm using are Hornet Strike for damage, Barrel Diffusion for multishot, Lethal Torrent for fire rate and multishot, Primed Pistol Gambit for crit chance, Prime Target Cracker for crit damage.

And then I decide to go for Hydraulic Crosshairs to have more reliable crits because without this you only have 63% crit chance with the Primed version of Pistol Gambit and that kind of felt like a waste because you have this very nice crit multiplier and it felt like I was just not taking advantage of that 40% of the time.

And to top it off, I'm using Frostbite and Pistol Pestilence for a nice chunk of status but also viral damage.

Now, the performance is really good across the board. You do not have to swap your elemental combos around for different factions. You don't even need to finish the enemies of most of the time if you're getting headshots. Because then you're getting a headshot multiplier on top of your crit multiplier in the slash proc. So, if they're at half health and they have slash ticking on them they're probably gonna die.

When it comes to the Grineer the Vasto Prime feels really good across a wide variety of enemies because the low tier or low-level units are general just die from the upfront damage and when you're fighting the higher tier higher level units that are where your slash is gonna take over and they're gonna bleed to death.

It's not the best thing in the world when it comes to the Infested. And it's not because it lacks damage because it has more than enough to take care of them but because it's a semi-automatic pistol and there's generally a lot of the Infested coming at you at the same time.

And finally, we have the Corpus where the Vasto Prime really surprised me because I honestly thought the slash procs and the damage from slash procs would be more of a factor than they ended up being. They don't do an awful lot. Luckily though the weapon does a ton of upfront damage. So, if you're getting headshots and you're getting that massive crit multiplier you're gonna take down even the toughest units with just a couple of shots.

Also, the Vasto Prime sounds pretty good and even though the reload animation doesn't actually make an awful lot of sense when you look at it from different angles. It's still really cool.

So, what do I think about this weapon overall? Well, I think it's absolutely fantastic. It's sort of a less impactful more pleasant version of the Lex. And it's mostly in the sound and recoil. The Lex sounds more powerful but it also kicks far more aggressively which over a long period of time makes it a less pleasant to use. This weapon is good like really seriously good.

And it's pretty much all about the Vasto Prime. So, I thank you very much for reading. I hope you've enjoyed the Vasto Prime Build and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
