<span>Hey guys. </span><span>And today we’re going to continue Excalibur <a href="https://warframeblog.com/warframe-builds/">Builds series</a> and take a look at Excalibur Radial Javelin Build.</span><!--more-->

So, for Excalibur Radial Javelin Build, I'm using Steel Charge as its aura though it doesn't really benefit it in any way. It's just there so it fits the polarity and adds a ton of capacity for me to play around with. So, if you have the basic Excalibur that doesn't have any polarity in the Aura you can slap on Energy Siphon or Corrosive Projection there.

Then I'm using Primed Vigor because I have Primed Vigor and it provides a little bit of health and shields but you can use whatever you want. You don't even have to use a defensive mode here because you're gonna be killing enemies from pretty far away. And then I'm using Augur Reach and Stretch for a good amount of range without sacrificing any strength like you would with Overextended. This is really nice because you can hit enemies that are really far away.

And then I start on Primed Flow, you can use the regular one if you don't have the prime version, just to have a bigger energy pool so I can bank more energy. After that, I'm using a fully ranked Fleeting Expertise and Streamline for maximum power efficiency which caps at 175. So, it's actually over capped a little bit and this is because we don't need duration and we want to make Radial Javelin as cheap as possible so we can spam it. And we top it off with some power strength. So, we have Intensify, Transient Fortitude, and Power Drift so we can actually do some damage.

Now, as I said it's already this is the more efficient version of the Excalibur Radial Javelin Build because I generally don't like to build my frames to rely on other frames, something like [Trinity](https://warframeblog.com/trinity-energy-vampire-build/) or Harrow. And while it doesn't do as much damage as a build that would run Blind Rage and just go full-on power strength. It is self-sustainable. You don't even need [Zenurik](https://warframeblog.com/zenurik-focus-tree/), you can just survive on picking up energy orbs here and there. But if you have Zenurik you can just pop the energy regen and just stand in one spot and spam Javelin.

## How does Excalibur Radial Javelin Build perform?

This is not a sortie kind of setup. It just doesn't do enough damage but it's fantastic for just farming stuff on the Star Chart. You can pick something like IO on Jupiter to stand on one of the elevated spots and just spam Javelin throughout and [farm relics](https://warframeblog.com/how-to-farm-relics/) or something.

Things I like about this Excalibur Radial Javelin Build the most though and why I prefer it over the more damaging and less efficient version is that it's not limited to those kinds of missions. You can just take it into an extermination and use it whenever you run into a big room full of enemies and if the situation demands it you can even pull out your Exalted Blade and start swinging that around instead. The only thing that you can't really do with this build is blind enemies with the [Radial Blind](https://warframeblog.com/excalibur-radial-blind-build/) because you have so little duration they're gonna be out of it almost instantly. But other than that it's a very fun and versatile Excalibur build that you can just faff around with on the Star Chart.

## Furious Javelin Augment Mod

You can even turn this into a full-on melee setup by taking out Flow and putting in Furious Javelin which will increase your melee damage whenever you use Radial Javelin. But bear in mind that will require some tweaking on your end because you need some duration otherwise the melee buff is gonna be very short. The best way to do that, in my opinion, would be to take out Fleeting Expertise and replace it with either Continuity or the primed version of Continuity.

<span>So, that’s pretty much it for the Excalibur Radial Javelin Build. I thank you very much for reading. I hope you’ve enjoyed the article and it was helpful and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.</span>
