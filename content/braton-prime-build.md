Hey guys! Welcome to another Warframe article and today I want to take a quick look at one of my favourite primary rifles<!--more--> a weapon that you will run into no matter what. Whether it is the mk1 version the standard version the primed version or for the lucky few of you even the Vandal version. It is a weapon that I never made an article about despite its still being one of my most used rifles and a weapon that will always have a special place in my heart - the Braton Prime.

Now, the prime version of the Braton was first introduced to the game roughly four and a half years ago with Update 9: Vor's Revenge which added a bunch of new mission types into the Void and of course it introduced the very talkative Corrupted Vor.

## How to get Braton Prime?

The parts for Braton Prime are scattered all over the place with the rarest one being the receiver which is only obtainable from the Lith B2 relic at the moment. Everything else is obtainable from either two three or even four relics in the case of the stock. The Braton Prime doesn't have any mastery rank requirement whatsoever. So, you can get it as soon as you can [get your hands on the relics](https://warframeblog.com/how-to-farm-relics/).

## Braton Prime Stats

The Braton Prime does 35 damage with each shot. 21 is slash, 12.25 is puncture, and 1.75 is impact. It is an automatic rifle that fires 9.58 rounds every second with 75 rounds in the magazine 375 rounds in total and a reload time of 2.2 seconds. It has 10% crit chance with a two times multiplier and 20% status chance.

Now, I know this is very much a personal preference but I honestly think this is the best sounding automatic rifle in the game. It sounds so good. You're gonna feel each shot and I like that. And it's also not too shabby when it comes to accuracy either. It's not perfect but it's not exactly spraying all over the place.

## Braton Prime 3 Forma Build

Now, when it comes to the setup on the Braton I'm running a fairly simple three forma build where I've added three V. And it's running Serration for damage, Split Chamber for multishot, Point Strike and Argon Scope for critical chance, Vital Sense for a critical damage, Thermite Rounds for a heat damage and a status chance, and finally Malignant Force which is combined with High Voltage for a corrosive damage and even more status chance.{{< image title="Braton Prime Build" alt="My current Braton Prime Build" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/braton-prime-build-1024x640.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/braton-prime-build-1024x640.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/braton-prime-build-300x188.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/braton-prime-build-768x480.png 768w">}}

Now, the damage of the weapon isn't the most amazing thing in the world even on the primed version. It was starting to fall off somewhere between level 70 and 80 but that's still more than enough to get you through the entire Star Charge do fissure missions, nightmare missions, and even early sorties. Just don't take it into a sortie assassination or you're gonna be there for a while. I would also recommend you pick up at least Carrier with Ammo Case because the ammo capacity on the Braton is not the best thing in the world. Especially as you start going up against higher-level enemies that can take a couple of shots. So yeah even the prime version of the Braton does above-average damage at best but I honestly do not care. It's not one of my favourite primary rifles because it does a lot of damage. It's one of my favourites because it looks amazing it sounds amazing it has just the right amount of kick. And the fire rate, it's just right. I don't know how else I should describe it. The rhythm, it's just&#8230; it's perfect. It's not too fast to where you stop kind of feeling each shot but it's not too slow either.

So, I would very much recommend you give this weapon a shot. I mean, I've had it for years now and it's still one of my favourites. It's kind of weird making a review of sorts for a weapon that I've had for years. I think this might actually be the first prime weapon that I like really farmed for in the game. I don't even remember when or how I got it anymore but I did get it in the end and I loved it and I still love it today. So, once again even though it may not be the best weapon in the world I would very much recommend you give it a shot. It's amazing. And as always I thank you very much for reading and I will see you next time guys. Bye-bye.
