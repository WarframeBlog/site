It is considered the same mod as its Rare counterpart, and thus both mods cannot be equipped together. 

This mod can be purchased unranked from Baro Ki'Teer for 100,000 credits and 350 ducats. Note however that Baro Ki'Teer's stock changes with each appearance, and may not have this item available at every time. Baro Ki'Teer is the only way to get {{ .primedMod }} aside from buying other players. The trade tax for trading {{ .primedMod }} from another player is 1 million credits.
