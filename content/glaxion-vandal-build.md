Hey guys and welcome to another Weapon Build article. Today we're going to take a quick look at Glaxion Vandal which you can currently get by scoring four thousand or more points in the Endurance version of the Hostile Mergers Operation.<!--more-->

The Glaxion Vandal has mastery rank 12 and it's a primary beam weapon that does 29 cold damage per damage tick. It comes with 14% critical chance, a standard 2.0x critical multiplier, and a very nice 38% status chance. The weapon can also deal damage up to 12 times per second and it drains 0.5 ammo every time it does so. It has 100 rounds in the magazine with 1000 rounds in total and it has a pretty sweet reload time of 1.8 seconds. Also, the beam of the Glaxion Vandal can only reach up to 24 meters at base. 

So, all in all, it's just a straight-up upgrade to the standard Glaxion - higher base damage, higher critical and status chance, larger magazine, larger ammo capacity, and faster reload speed. But wait, there's more the Glaxion Vandal also is a little bit of AOE because it will splash all of its damage at the point of impact in about a 3 meter area.

Now, when it comes to the build I played around with a bunch of different stuff and the one I ended up liking the most requires 3 forma where you add two V's and a dash. 

So, I'm running Serration for damage, Split Chamber for multishot, Point Strike for a critical chance, Vital Sense for critical damage. Then I ended up going with Argon Scope to make the crits more reliable. And I topped it off with Infected Clip, Malignant Force, and High Voltage for a ton of corrosive damage and status chance. 

Though this is mostly for the Grineer and the Corrupted. And for the Infested and Corpus I'm running this **Glaxion Vandal Build**

Here is thermite rounds malignant force and infected clip for a channel gas and status now as I said already I've tried a bunch of different setups on this mainly setups that either scale Dallas crit or no clear whatsoever and they were in comparison to this one so bad I just ended up going back to this and it's because the combination of pretty reliable crit and very deliberate stages blocking is just really strong the corrosive setup will destroy enemy armor and then just Massacre everything this of behind which also works pretty well for the infested that don't have any armor to begin with and the gas setup is well one of the better gas in apps you can use right now just look at it I mean what is there to say about this is just a much better version of the GAC seein that fits into the game that warframe is now much better than the Glock seein that was designed for a completely different game it's a similar situation to the opticore versus optic or vandal thing that we had with the exception of the vandal here being just a Stretch-up upgrade and I don't think it's necessarily the better stats I think it's mostly the Splash Damage that you get on the van dough that makes this weapon a lot better the better stats are of course good it can't hurt to have more damage but I think the Splash Damage is what really sets this apart from the standard Galaxian it means that you don't necessarily have to run gas to get some AoE device to run gas because now the gas EO is even more ridiculous but you know you can run corrosive and you've still got a little bit of AoE which is nice and makes your clear a lot smoother so I'm definitely going to give the Glaxion Vandal a thumbs up it's just an awesome weapon that's fun it's strong and it's free so even if you don't like it there is no reason for you not to get it at least for as long as the event is up datas and I think that's pretty much all I wanted to say so I think you very much for watching as always guys I hope you've enjoyed the article and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
