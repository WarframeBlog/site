Hey guys and welcome to another [Weapon Build](/primary-weapon-builds/ "Builds for Primary Weapons") article. Today we're going to take a quick look at **Glaxion Vandal** which you can currently get by scoring four thousand or more points in the Endurance version of the *Hostile Mergers Operation*.<!--more-->

The Glaxion Vandal has mastery rank 12, and it's a primary beam weapon that does 29 cold damage per damage tick. It comes with 14% critical chance, a standard 2.0x critical multiplier, and a charming 38% status chance. The weapon can also deal damage up to 12 times per second, and it drains 0.5 ammo every time it does so. It has 100 rounds in the magazine with 1000 rounds in total, and it has a pretty sweet reload time of 1.8 seconds. Also, the beam of the Glaxion Vandal can only reach up to 24 meters at the base. 

So, all in all, it's just a straight-up upgrade to the standard Glaxion - higher base damage, higher critical and status chance, larger magazine, larger ammo capacity, and faster reload speed. But wait, there's more the Glaxion Vandal also is a little bit of AOE because it will splash all of its damage at the point of impact in about a 3-meter area. 

## Glaxion Vandal Build
Now, when it comes to the build, I played around with a bunch of different stuff, and the one I ended up liking the most requires three forma where you add two V's and a dash. 

## Glaxion Vandal Anti-Grineer Build
{{< image title=\"Warframe Glaxion Vandal Anti-Grineer Build\" alt=\"Glaxion Vandal Anti-Grineer 3 Forma Build\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/warframe-glaxion-vandal-anti-grineer-3-forma-build.jpg\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/warframe-glaxion-vandal-anti-grineer-3-forma-build.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/06/warframe-glaxion-vandal-anti-grineer-3-forma-build-768.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/06/warframe-glaxion-vandal-anti-grineer-3-forma-build-640.jpg 640w\" >}}
So, I'm running Serration for damage, Split Chamber for multishot, Point Strike for a critical chance, Vital Sense for critical damage. Then I ended up going with Argon Scope to make the crits more reliable. And I topped it off with Infected Clip, Malignant Force, and High Voltage for a ton of corrosive damage and status chance. Though this is mostly for the Grineer and the Corrupted. 

And for the Infested and Corpus I'm running this **Glaxion Vandal Build**:
{{< image title=\"Warframe Glaxion Vandal Anti Corpus/Infested Build\" alt=\"Warframe Glaxion Vandal Anti Corpus/Infested 3 Forma Build\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/warframe-glaxion-vandal-anti-corpus-3-forma-build.jpg\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/warframe-glaxion-vandal-anti-corpus-3-forma-build.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/06/warframe-glaxion-vandal-anti-corpus-3-forma-build-768.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/06/warframe-glaxion-vandal-anti-corpus-3-forma-build-640.jpg 640w\" >}}

Here I just swapped High Voltage for Thermite Rounds, so it's now gas damage type instead of corrosive. 

As I said already, I've tried a bunch of different builds on this weapon and in comparison to Glaxion Vandal builds above they were terrible. And it's because the combination of pretty reliable crit and very deliberate status procing is just powerful. 

All in all, the **Glaxion Vandal** is a formidable weapon. It's fun and strong. Also, it's free. So even if you don't like it there is no reason for you not to get it. And that is pretty much all I wanted to say. So, thank you very much for reading. I hope youâ€™ve enjoyed the Glaxion Vandal Build article and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
