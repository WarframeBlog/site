Hey guys and today we're gonna take a look at Equinox Focus Farm Build. Equinox is probably the best focus farming warframe in the entire game at the moment. But don't be fooled by that he's not just a focus farmer he can do a lot of other stuff as well. But about that, we will talk in another article.<!--more-->

So, for Equinox Focus Farm Build, I'm using Energy Siphon as its aura because there is honestly nothing worse than running out of energy. And it basically sustains you the entire mission assuming you will pick up an energy orb here and there. However, if you are running with the [Zenurik Focus School](https://warframeblog.com/zenurik-focus-tree/) you can run either Steel Charge for more melee damage or even Corrosive Projection to strip away some of the enemy armor. Then I'm running Rush in the Exilus Slot which is really good for this kind of build because you want to move around really fast and with Rush you get 1.49 sprint speed which is really fast.

And yes, I'm actually running Vitality on this Equinox build even though we're gonna be crowd controlling most of the enemies and this is because of the new enemies spawning. You're most likely going to be running this on Adaro and as you progress through the mission you will see more bombards and eximus units. And if you dare pout and accidentally agro an eximus bombard he will one shoot you if you don't have any kind of defense.

Now. after that I'm using Overextended, Stretch, and Augur Reach for as much range as possible so the initial cost of Rest & Rage covers a decently sized area. But also because we're using Calm & Frenzy which augment mod for Rest & Rage to where if you kill an enemy that's affected by either Rest or Rage it will spread the effect to nearby enemies. And this augment is affected by range so the more range you have the more effective the augment is.

Then to get some efficiency I'm using Fleeting Expertise that two ranks from the top to save on some duration and a fully ranked Streamline for 170% efficiency. This makes the Rest & Rage super cheap so you can spam it. And finally, I have Primed Continuity to balance out Fleeting Expertise and get some extra duration.

And with this Equinox Focus Farm Build your Rest & Rage will have about 25 seconds as far as duration concerned which would be more than enough for you to kill everything.

Now, if you really want to pimp this build up I would recommend going for [Arcane Fury](https://warframeblog.com/top-arcanes-to-boost-your-damage/) which gives your critical hits a 40% chance to increase your melee damage by 120% for 12 seconds and [Arcane](https://warframeblog.com/arcane-rework/) Strike which gives your melee hits a 10% chance to increase your melee attack speed by 40% for 12 seconds.

Now, there's no doubt that this is the best and most reliable focus forming build in the entire game. However, it's not gonna work on its own. You're gonna need a decent melee weapon as well. People generally go for either whips or polearms. Both of which have a lot of range on their slide attacks. As for me, I'm using the Guandao polearm and I have Primed Reach and a riven mod that adds extra range on top of it. This gives my slide attacks a stupendous amount of range that is very much not necessary to start out. You also do not need Maiming Strike which a lot of people use as well to guarantee a crit on a slide attack. Because if you have a decent melee weapon it's gonna one-shot most enemies anyway because weapons do more damage with a slide attack than with a normal hit. And if an occasional bombard or an eximus bombard even breaks your chain because you're not gonna one shot it well it's not the end of the world. It happens.

Now, as far as the gameplay is concerned it is pretty simple. You're basically just running around continuously spamming Rest & Rage wherever you go to crowd control all the enemies that you see. Some people use macros to spam Rest & Rage but I find that is really boring I would rather play the game myself so I don't. And please don't be discouraged if you try this out and you're not getting the same focus numbers that you see people getting in videos because people generally pick the best clip to show you that it really works. And said yeah you're gonna get 150,000 [focus](https://warframeblog.com/warframe-new-focus-2-5/) with one pickup if you have an affinity booster and it's a double affinity weekend and the focus pick up spawned in a good place so there was a room full of enemies and none of the enemies turned around then yeah you're probably gonna get like 20k at best.

Can you get mad amounts of focus with a single pickup? Yeah, you very much can but most of the time you're just gonna get an average amount of focus. And sometimes you're gonna blow it up and you're gonna get like 5k at best especially when you're first starting out and you're learning it. The first couple of missions are gonna be somewhat mad because you, for example, don't know that you should cast Rest & Rage on every single door because there are probably enemies behind it. So, if you really want to [farm focus](https://warframeblog.com/how-to-farm-focus-points/) this way just stick to it and as time goes on you're gonna get faster and calmer and you're gonna get more and more focus with each pickup.

So, that’s pretty much it for Equinox Focus Farm Build. I thank you very much for reading. I hope you’ve enjoyed the article and it was helpful and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
