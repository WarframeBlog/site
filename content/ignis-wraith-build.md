Hey guys and welcome to another weapon build article. Today we will take a look at the Ignis Wraith. The Ignis Wraith got buffed recently and most importantly the beam weapon type itself. So, let me show you how strong the Ignis has become.<!--more-->

So, first of all, the Ignis Wraith is really ammo efficient, you can actually hold down the trigger for nearly a minute. One minute of constant damage that kills pretty much everything in an instant, and it only has a reload time of 1.7 second. And that's amazing!

But what about the stats? Well, the most important stats are notably changed. Damage increased from 25 Heat per sec to 35 Heat per tick, Critical Chance increased from 12% to 17%, Critical Damage increased from 2.0x to 2.5x, and also Range increased from 20m to 27m.

The Ignis may not go through the walls anymore and it now requires Punch Through to do so. But overall a much better and stronger weapon. And it still kills everything on all the different planets very easily. Even level 100 armored units like the Heavy Gunner is no problem for the Ignis. Same goes for Corpus Techs level 100, with a gas build, you can take down them within seconds.

## Ignis Wraith Star Chart Build

In terms of modding, you have a lot of possibilities here. Ignis Wraith build for killing all the enemies on the Star Chart can look like this.

This build may cost 7 forma but your damage will definitely be enough. But, as I said, you have more possibilities. For example, you can also add next mods: Primed Shred, Sinister Reach, and Combustion Beam. All three mods combined are just amazing, perfect for killing lots of enemies in all type of missions.

## Ignis Wraith Huge Radius Build

If you just want to have a weapon that kills everything in a huge radius, I recommend you using a build like this:

<img src="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ignis-wraith-build-kill-everything-1024x303.png" title="Ignis Wraith Huge Radius Build" alt="Ignis Wraith Build that kill enemies in a huge radius" width="750" height="222" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-998" srcset="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ignis-wraith-build-kill-everything-1024x303.png 1024w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ignis-wraith-build-kill-everything-300x89.png 300w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ignis-wraith-build-kill-everything-768x227.png 768w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ignis-wraith-build-kill-everything.png 1469w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />

You may lose your crit stats but enemies on the Star Chart are one hit anyways. Depending on the faction you're facing against, you need to adjust your build a little bit. Against level 100 Heavy Gunner dual stat mods aren't that important, 90% elemental mods are still better in this case.

Also, Vigilante Fervor is an amazing mod for the Ignis. It increases your fire rate which means your dps and the chance to apply lots of corrosive procs is higher and you're able to achieve some orange crits at the same time.

## Anti-Corpus Ignis Wraith Build

Last but not least, the Anti-Corpus Ignis build. For this build, you can simply use Infected Clip and Thermite Rounds for gas damage. The replaceable mod in this build is Hummer Shot.

<img src="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ignis-wraith-build-anti-corpus-1024x310.png" title="Ignis Wraith Anti-Corpus Build" alt="Ignis Wraith modded for gas damage" width="750" height="227" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1006" srcset="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ignis-wraith-build-anti-corpus-1024x310.png 1024w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ignis-wraith-build-anti-corpus-300x91.png 300w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ignis-wraith-build-anti-corpus-768x233.png 768w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ignis-wraith-build-anti-corpus.png 1433w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />

The only reason why I'm using Hammer Shot is to maintain the other builds with their polarities. So, if you want to use something else you may have to use another forma. But to be honest, it's not worth it.

Well, as I already said in the beginning, Ignis Wraith is a strong weapon. So, if you are looking for an efficient weapon for killing lots of enemies on the Star Chart, the Ignis may be something for you.

Anyway, I hope you enjoyed reading today's Ignis Wraith Build article and as always leave a comment if you want to and I'll see you in the next article.
