Hello guys. Today I wanted to talk about how to quickly farm the new warframe Gauss.<!--more-->

## New Frame Gauss
Gauss is a speedster themed frame who uses his extreme speed to trample his foes and boost his combat capabilities. Gauss was introduced to Warframe on 29th August 2019 as part of Update 25.7: Saint of Altra.

## How To Get Gauss
### Where To Get Gauss Blueprint
Gauss blueprint can be purchased directly through the Warframe market for Credits. Gauss's blueprint will require an investment of 30,000 Credits.

### Where To Farm Gauss's Parts
Gauss's component blueprints are acquired through the new Disruption node <b>Kelpie on Sedna</b>. The blueprints can drop upon competition of Round 3 if four conduits are defended or upon competition of Round 4 and above if three or more conduits are defended.

Once you have done **farming Gauss's parts**, go to your foundry, build them, and build the Gauss itself.
