Hey guys and welcome to another Warframe build article. Today, I'm going to talk about the Wisp Reservoirs Build that I've been using on the Wisp because I really like it and I think you might enjoy it too. <!--more-->

## Wisp Reservoirs Build
So, the build only requires two forma where you'll add a V and a D though if you plan to go into an Umbra build later on I would definitely not add the D. I will choose a different polarity which would probably be a V. 

{{< image title=\"Warframe Wisp Reservoirs Build\" alt=\"Warframe Wisp Reservoirs 2 Forma Build\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wisp-reservoirs-2-forma-build.jpg\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wisp-reservoirs-2-forma-build.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wisp-reservoirs-2-forma-build-768.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wisp-reservoirs-2-forma-build-640.jpg 640w\" >}}

The aura I'm gonna be running most of the time is Corrosive Projection which kind of suits this build because it's more of a supportive build but it's just a great aura overall which reduces enemy armor. It also fits the polarity the frame comes with which is definitely nice as well and you can switch it out for other things like Shield Disruption or even Energy Siphon though Energy Siphon for this Wisp Build is not entirely necessary. 

Then, for the exilus slot, I'm running one of the new mods Motus Signal which gives you 200% double jump strength and this for me personally works really well with Wisp`s passive where she's invisible while she's in the air. Bear in mind that this is very much personal preference. I like it because I don't have to bullet jump to get a lot of air or do any other fancy stuff. I simply double jump and I'm way high up in the air and I'm invisible for a very long time and I can slowly glide down. 

After that, I have Transient Fortitude that's fully ranked up for a ton of power strength, Blind Rage that's two ranks from the top to save on some efficiency, and finally Intensify for an additional power strength. 

Then I'm running some extra defense which is mostly a buffer so that I don't instantly die the second I hit the ground and there's like a high-level Corpus Tech nearby in the form of Vitality for a nice chunk of extra health. And I'm also running Steel Fiber for some extra armor. Now, this might not look like much because it's only 165 armor but with the amount of health you're gonna have in the end this gives you a huge effective health boost. 

Then I wanted my Motes to cover a bigger area so I'm running Augur Reach as well as Stretch for a nice chunk of extra range. And I decided to top it all off with the Rage which actually works really well with this kind of build because you're gonna be avoiding most damage by staying in the air but if you're running out of energy you can just land for a little bit, take a bit of damage which will be converted into energy via Rage, and then jump back up again. 

So let's take a look at how this Wisp Build actually works. Since the build is focused on the Reservoirs ability of the Wisp warframe by providing extra health, health regen, and movement speed as well as some crowd control with the Shock Motes, it's more of a supportive Wisp Build but in addition it's surprisingly tanky if you can stay in the air most of the time. 

Now, the way I generally do things is that I will pop down the Vitality Mote as soon as I get into a mission so I get the extra health and regen before I fully set up with all Motes. And at that point, I am basically unkillable because I have a ton of extra health, health regen, and speed. And everything that comes in where near Shock Motes gets shocked. After that, it's basically just a matter of staying in the air if you want to defense and sitting on the ground when you want some energy. 

Also, it's really nice if you get the timing down so you can plant Motes in between jumps. So, you jump up, you start casting the ability, and just as you hit the ground you pop down the Mote, and you jump back up again. It's really not that hard once you get used to it. It's a bit fiddly in the beginning because you also have to switch between the three different Motes as you're in the air but you get used to it. 

Now, unsurprisingly this Wisp Build works much better in mission types like Defense, Disruption, Mobile Defense, Survival, Interception. But it's still usable and sometimes even really useful in other mission types as well. If for example you periodically keep popping down the Haste Mote in a Capture mission you and/or your team will finish it much faster.

And that is pretty much it for the Wisp Reservoirs Build. So, thank you very much for reading. I hope you will like this build as much as I do and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
