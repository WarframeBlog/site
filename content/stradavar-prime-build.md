Hey guys and welcome to another Warframe article. Today we're gonna take a quick look at the one and only Stradavar Prime.

## How To Get Stradavar Prime
Now first things first to get the Stradavar Prime you will have to crack open some relics just like with any other Prime item. The blueprint is a rare drop from Neo S11 relic the barrel is an uncommon drop from the elite and for relic the receiver is a common drop from the missiles that three relic and finally the stock is a common drop from the axe ET to relic.

The Stradavar Prime just like the standard Stradavar comes with two different fire mods a fully automatic and a semi-automatic mod that you switch between by pressing the secondary fire button. And it's not just a fire mod change because the stats for each fire mod are completely different. 

Now, the weapon requires you to be at least mastery rank 12 to use it unless you bought it with Prime Access or platinum then you can use it right away. 

For the full auto mod the weapon does 30 damage per shot with 10.5 as impact, 10.5 as puncture, and 9 as slash. It has 24% crit chance, 2.6x crit multiplier, 12% status chance, and it can fire up to 10 rounds per second. 

For the semi-auto mod the damage jumps all the way up to 80 with 48 being slash 24 being puncture and only 8 being impact. It has 30% crit chance with 2.8x crit multiplier, and 22% status chance. But unfortunately the fire rate will go down to 3.33 which is pretty low and it means that there will be a delay between each shot and you simply cannot fire as fast as you can click unless you add a lot of fire rate. Also the semi-auto mod will drain 2 rounds per shot. The one additional benefit that you get here is a punch through onr meter which is very nice. 

And other than that the Stradavar Prime is very accurate in both mods though the full auto mod is a little bit less accurate it has 19 rounds in the magazine with 540 rounds in total and a reload time of 2 seconds. It comes with 3V polarities which is extremely nice for a primary weapon and that means that the two builds I have for you today don't require any forma whatsoever. You just need to slap on an Orokin Catalyst and get the weapon to its maximum rank. 

## Stradavar Prime Build
The first build is a little bit more front-loaded and it's running Serration for damage, Split Chamber for multishot, Point Strike for crit chance, Vital Sense for crit damage. Then Argon Scope for additional critical chance on a headshot when you're aiming for 9s. After that High voltage and Malignant Force for corrosive damage and Thermite Rounds for the heat damage. 

now, this Stradavar Prime Build while not as strong as the second build does feel better with the low level enemies sort of 50s to 70s because as I've said already it's far more front-loaded and it's also made more towards the full auto mod rather than the semi-auto mod because you want to proc corrosive a lot, one or two stacks of corrosive aren't gonna do that much. Though it will still perform admirably with the semi-auto mod especially when you're fighting something really tough and you want as much damage as possible. However, if all you want is just big chunky damage this is the Stradavar Prime Build that I would run instead. 

This one's running Serration for damage, Split Chamber for multishot, Point Strike for crit chance, Vital Sense for crit damage, Argon Scope for additional critical chance on a headshot. Then Hunter Munitions for additional slash procs on a crit, and finally, we have Malignant Force and Rime Rounds for viral damage. 

Now, this Stradavar Prime Build is not as front-loaded as the first one but it scales a lot better as the enemies grow in levels. So, it will blast through the Star Chart because it is more than enough front-loaded damage for that. Then it will sort of start to lose to the first build between levels 50 to 70 but as soon as you go up to 80-100 and beyond 100 it will start to win again. And it's also far more effective with the semi-auto mod rather than the full auto mod because the damage distribution is tilted more toward slash you get more crit, more status, and generally more damage. And it's also far more versatile because if you have viral and slash it doesn't really matter which faction you're fighting you're still gonna reduce their health by half and then bypass armor and shields whereas the actual corrosive proc is only effective versus armor. So, it's kind up to you as to which one you choose based on what you're doing or you can just have both and switch between them. 

So there we go the Stradavar Prime not bad not bad at all though if I were to complain about one thing it would definitely be the fire rate on the secondary fire I would prefer it if it was at least four maybe five because adding fire rate especially to the second viral build is not really doable without breaking the build or losing a considerable amount of damage the only reasonable of adding fire rate there is either via an arcane or via a ribbon that would replace one of the most that you already have there but also would have fire rate at the same time but that's more of a problem with crit or hybrid builds in general and not really the weapon out just like to be able to add a little bit more fire rate without having to use arcane acceleration or a ribbon but that's pretty much my only complaint other than that the weapon is actually quite nice and I've had a lot have fun with it so I would highly recommend you check it out it's just like solid and fun primary or two primaries rather because the two different fire mods really feel completely different and I think I've been blabbering for long enough So, I thank you very much for reading. I hope you've enjoyed the article and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.       

In conclusion, the Stradavar Prime is actually quite nice and I've had a lot fun with it so I would highly recommend you check it out. And it’s pretty much all I wanted to say. So, thank you very much for reading. I hope you’ve enjoyed the Stradavar Build article and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
