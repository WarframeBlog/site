Hey guys and today we're gonna take a look at the Limbo Rift Torrent Build.<!--more-->

So, for Limbo Rift Torrent Build, I'm using Energy Siphon as its aura mod just to get some more energy ticking. However, it's not that necessary especially if you're running [Zenurik Focus School](https://warframeblog.com/zenurik-focus-tree/) because you get energy from Energy Dash and Energy Siphon even in the rift. Then I'm using Primed Continuity and Narrow Minded for a ton of duration this makes my abilities last about 50 seconds which is more than enough. And this with the constant energy ticks you get from Energy Siphon and Streamline means that you can keep going forever. You don't even need to pick up energy orbs.

After that, I'm using Cunning Drift, Stretch, and Augur Reach to balance out Narrow Minded and get some extra range for Cataclysm so it covers a decently sized area and I don't have to recast it too much which is followed up by Natural Talent for faster cast time on both Stasis and Cataclysm. And this makes the whole Limbo build feel a lot smoother.

Then I'm using the Rift Torrent augment which augments Rift Surge and makes it give you 30% extra damage for each enemy affected by Rift Surge while you're in the rift. And I'm using this to scale damage on my [melee weapon](https://warframeblog.com/melee-weapons/) where I have a pretty beefy condition overload build. And to top it all off I'm using Quick Thinking to prevent one shot when I'm transitioning from Cataclysm into the rift by dashing or I'm just recasting Cataclysm or even Stasis.

## Limbo Rift Torrent Build Arcanes

Now, when it comes to [arcanes](https://warframeblog.com/eidolons-drop-arcane-enhancements/) since the majority of your damage is gonna come from melee I would personally go for Arcane Fury which gives you a 10% chance on a crit to increase melee damage by 120% for 12 seconds and [Arcane Strike](https://warframeblog.com/top-arcanes-to-boost-your-damage/) which gives you a 10% chance on hits to increase melee attack speed by 40% for 12 seconds.

Now, here's what you want to do with this Limbo Build. So, first of all, you want to dash into the rift. Then you want to activate Stasis and slap down Cataclysm. Once Cataclysm is down you want to activate Rift Surge and start meleeing stuff.

This is, in my opinion, the best endgame build when it comes to the Grineer and the Infested because of how safe it is and how much damage it can do. The damage may not be as crazy as it is on [Peacemaker Mesa](https://warframeblog.com/mesa-peacemaker-build/) or if you're using Ash with the Seeking Shuriken augment and your stripping away all the enemy armor. But the added safeness of you freezing everything inside your Cataclysm is just amazing.

The only weakness of this build is the Corpus. The edges do not work versus the corpus because of nullifiers and Combatants or Scrambus units. It's the same thing as it was with Mag they just won't let you do what you need to do. Whether it is a nullifier field touching your Cataclysm and collapsing it which is certain death or even a combatants or Scrambus unit randomly turning off your Stasis which is also certain death.

I love this Limbo build so much mainly because it's completely up to you if you play it well you can do amazing things. But if you balls it up well, you're probably gonna die. It sometimes feels like you're just straight-up cheating when you get into the rhythm and you keep everything going and you're just butchering waves of enemies without them being able to do a damn thing. You're no longer playing by the game's rules with this Limbo build. The game is playing by your rules. You tell it what to do and when to do it. And it's super satisfying when you're playing it well.

So, I would definitely recommend you check this Limbo Rift Torrent Build out. And it’s pretty much it for the Limbo Build. And I thank you very much for reading as always guys I hope you’ve enjoyed the article and it was helpful and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
