Hey guys and welcome to another warfare build. Today we’re going to take a look at Rhino Iron Skin Build.<!--more-->

{{< promo >}}

This is the build I think most people imagine when you mention Rhino - a beefy dude with iron skin that's running through missions not giving a damn.

So, this is my take on the build and it's probably my most used one. It's running Energy Siphon for its Aura but you can use whatever you want. You can use Corrosive Projection. I just like having the extra energy from Energy Siphon. Then I'm using Transient Fortitude and Blind Rage that's two ranks from the top to avoid efficiency issues. Intensify and Power Drift for 281% power strength. Then I added Iron Shrapnel which allows you to detonate your Iron Skin getting rid of the buff which is something you can't normally do and immediately recast it. It does a little bit of damage and knocks enemies back as well but we mostly use it to recast Iron Skin and get it full again.

Then to make sure I can always detonate my Iron Skin and immediately recast it when I get in trouble I'm running Streamline and fully ranked Fleeting Expertise which gives you 45% positive efficiency which makes Iron Skin very cheap. This in combination with the energy you get from Energy Siphon means that you can always recast your Iron Skin. You will always have enough energy.

And finally, I have Gladiator Aegis and Steel Fiber for a ton of armour which also gives you more health on Iron Skin. Rhino Iron Skin Build is in my opinion as a Rhino as it gets. You have a beefy Iron Skin and it's fantastic for either sortie missions or some high-level nightmare missions or even fissure missions on something like Sedna or Pluto. It's not the most engaging setup in the world you basically just press Iron Skin and then when it's running low you detonate it and recast it again. And that's about it when it comes to gameplay with this Rhino Build. But that's, in my opinion, a strong point because you don't have to worry about your health you don't have to worry about knockdowns or combining abilities together you just put on Iron Skin and you can have a blast with your weapons. And that's good. Every now and then you just don't want to worry about these things and you just want to have a blast with a new weapon.

So, that's pretty much it for the build. So, I thank you very much for reading as always. I hope you've enjoyed this Rhino Build and it was helpful and I will see you next time. Bye-bye!
