Hey guys and welcome to another [Warframe guide](/guides/ "Warframe guides") article. And the Mask of the Revenant update is finally here and it brought us a new warframe - Revenant and a miniquest which you need to complete to get your hands on the Revenant.<!--more-->

So, here is a step by step process to obtain Revenant(**make sure that you’ve reached Observer﻿ (rank 2) with the Quills otherwise you cannot start Nakak's miniquest**):

<b>Step 1</b> - Visit Nakak in Cetus and select the "Mask" dialogue option. After listening to all her dialogue buy the Mask of the Lost One from her, it will cost you one [Cetus Wisp](/farm-cetus-wisp/ "How to farm Cetus Wisp").

<b>Step 2</b> - Equip that mask to your Operator and keep the mask throughout the Revenant Quest. You can remove it after it finishes. You can do so straight from Cetus by going to Equipment > Operator via the ESC menu while in Operator Mode.

<b>Step 3</b> - Go out into the Plains of Eidolon during the night with the mask equipped. There will be a marked area with an item for you to find. After you find this item location you need to interact with it by pressing x on your keyboard.

<b>Step 4</b> - Once you have found the item and if you don't have any crafted Revenant parts, you must return to Cetus and talk to Konzu. Using the Bounty Board, select a Bounty with any Revenant part that you don't have already in its drop table. Complete the Bounty until you receive the Revenant part. You need at least two Revenant parts for this whole quest to complete. So, obtain any two Revenant parts from bounties.

In my case, I got Revenant Chassis Blueprint and Revenant Neuroptics Blueprint on my first runs of 4-Stage Bounty and the 5-Stage Bounty respectively. But with Revenant Systems Blueprint it was a little bit difficult and I got it only after completing the 3-Stage Bounty eight times.

<b>Step 5</b> - Build Revenant parts and claim them from your Foundry. You can build all Revenant parts at the same time. If you don't have two crafted Revenant parts when you go to PoE on the next step then you will need to return to Cetus once more(see Step 4). 

<b>Step 6</b> - Return to the Plains of Eidolon with the Mask of the Lost One equipped and find the item within the marked area. After doing so, yet another marker will appear in your minimap. Search the area, find the item, and follow Nakak’s instructions. 

<b>Step 7</b> - Fight the mini-boss. Use your operator and frame to take him down and after that, you will receive Revenant Blueprint and then you’re done!

And that’s pretty much it for the How to get Revenant guide. I wish you good luck with RNG and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
