Hey guys and welcome to another Weapon Build article. Today we're going to take a quick look at our newest sniper rifle that was released with update 25 - the Komorex.<!--more-->

Now, first things first, if you want to get your hands on the Komorex you will first have to research it in the Energy Lab in your dojo. And once it's done to build a weapon you have to put in 20,000 credits, five Fieldron, 6,200 Ferrite, 300 [Hexenon](/hexenon-farming/ "How and Where to get Hexenon"), and one Forma.

The Komorex is a mastery rank 8 primary sniper rifle that does 87 damage per shot: 41.8 is slash, 36.5 is puncture, and only 8.7 is impact. Unlike many other sniper rifles the Komorex isn't focused on crit and it focuses on status instead. So, it has the lowest critical chance out of all the sniper rifles at 16% with a 2.1x critical multiplier and the highest status chance at 35%. 

Also, it comes with a pretty sizable 20 rounds magazine. Though the ammo reserve isn't that great at only 40 rounds. It can fire up to six rounds per second with pinpoint accuracy once you're zoomed in and it has a terrible three seconds reload time. 

So, just like any other sniper rifle the weapon is horrificly inaccurate when you're not scoped in but once you do zoom in at the two time zoom you will get 50% reduced recoil, so the weapon is very stable, and you also get two meters of punch through. However, once you jump to the 3.5 times zoom the weapon gains 100% of its base damage as a Viral explosion with a 3 meter radius and you lose 75% of your fire rate. Though be aware if you're zoomed in all the way it does do self damage. 

## Komorex Corrosive Build
Now, the build I ended up liking the most in the end, requires three forma with two V's and a dash. And I did actually ended up scaling crit so it's a Hybrid Build. So, the mods are Serration for damage then Split Chamber for multishot, Point Strike and Argon Scope which makes the crits pretty reliable. Then we have Vital Sense to bump up the above average critical multiplier. And after that we have Infected Clip, Malignant Force, and High Voltage for high corrosive damage and status chance. Though this build is mostly for Grineer and sometimes Infested. 

## Komorex Gas Build
And for the Corpus and Infested as well, I use Malignant Force, Thermite Rounds, and Infected Clip for lots of gas. 

Those of course not the only way you can build the Komorex. There's actually quite a lot of stuff you can do with it. It's very flexible which is why I like it so feel free to experiment.

And the two builds that I thought about personally but I ended up not doing them because I wasn't really feeling the way they were going was this one: 

This Komorex Build is very similar to what I'm using but it focuses on Viral and it's using Fanged Fusillade to boost the slash. 

And here is another Komorex Build which ignores critical chance completely and it sort of doubles down on the elemental damage so you have Stormbringer and Infected Clip combined with High Voltage and Malignant Force for an insane amount of Corrosive damage. Then we have Primed Cryo Rounds for a lot of Cold damage. After that goes Vigilante Armaments for some extra multishot. 

But anyway the Corrosive version of the Komorex build that I ended up choosing is just better versus the Grineer and the Corrupted. And it's pretty much one tapped sortie level Grineers once you get Argon Scope because at that point your critical chance is very reliable and you're going to crit on every shot. 

And unsurprisingly the same thing will happen to the Infested as well. Though most of the time for the Infested I do prefer the Komorex Gas Build because the amount of AoE damage you can get from a critical headshot is ridiculous. Though you have to be kind of careful not to proc it on yourself since it really hurts. And finally, we have the Corpus where the Gas Build is just hilarious. The damage is so good. 

And now we come to the conclusion. So, what do I actually think about the Komorex? Well, I am conflicted. On the one hand, I hate the terrible reload time, presence of self-damage, and the low fire rate. But on the other hand, it has a pretty sizable 20 rounds magazine and you're mostly going to be shooting at things that are pretty far away so it's difficult to actually hit yourself. Also, unlike many other sniper rifles the Komorex is focused on status. Therefore, 
I would still recommend you checking this weapon out. And that is pretty much all I wanted to say. So, thank you very much for reading. I hope youâ€™ve enjoyed the Komorex Build article and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
