Hey guys and welcome to another Weapon Build article. Today we're going to take a quick look at our newest sniper rifle that was released with update 25 - the Komorex.<!--more-->

Now, first things first, if you want to get your hands on the Komorex you will first have to research it in the Energy Lab in your dojo. And once it's done to build a weapon you have to put in 20,000 credits, five Fieldron, 6,200 Ferrite, 300 Hexenon, and one Forma.

The Komorex is a mastery rank 8 primary sniper rifle that does 87 damage per shot: 41.8 is slash, 36.5 is puncture, and only 8.7 is impact. Unlike many other sniper rifles the Komorex isn't focused on crit and it focuses on status instead. So, it has the lowest critical chance out of all the sniper rifles at 16% with a 2.1x critical multiplier and the highest status chance at 35%. 

Also, it comes with a pretty sizable 20 rounds magazine. Though the ammo reserve isn't that great at only 40 rounds. It can fire up to six rounds per second with pinpoint accuracy once you're zoomed in and it has a terrible three seconds reload time. 

So, just like any other sniper rifle the weapon is horrificly inaccurate when you're not scoped in but once you do zoom in at the two time zoom you will get 50% reduced recoil, so the weapon is very stable, and you also get two meters of punch through. However, once you jump to the 3.5 times zoom the weapon gains 100% of its base damage as a Viral explosion with a 3 meter radius and you lose 75% of your fire rate. Though be aware if you're zoomed in all the way it does do self damage.

Now, the build I ended up liking the most in the end requires three forma with two V's and a dash. and I did actually end up scaling Krait so it's a hybrid build so the mods are serration for damage then split chamber for multi shot fault buy points rank and Argan scope which makes the crits pretty reliable then we have my two cents to bump up the above average critical multiplier and then we have infected scope malignant force and high-voltage for high corrosive damage and Status chance though this is mostly for Grenier and sometimes infested so for the corpus and infested as well I have malignant force thermite rounds and in fact it clip for a crap-ton gasps those of course not the only way you can build them up and there's actually quite a lot of stuff you can do with it it's very flexible which is why I like it so feel free to experiment okay some people often think that I'm some kind of a higher entity that just commands builds onto people and you can only like my build but no I'm just showing you the bill that I personally like the most so feel free to try it out if you don't like it that's fine and the two bills that I thought about personally but I ended up not doing them because I wasn't really feeling the way they were going was this one which is very similar to what I'm doing but it focuses on viral and it's using fact fuselage to boost the slash and this one which ignore script completely and it sort of doubles down on the elemental damage so you have storm bringer and infected clip combined with high voltage and malignant force for an insane amount of corrosive damage and then you have Primed crowns for a ton of code damage and vigilante armaments for some extra multi-shot but anyway the corrosive version of the bill that I ended up choosing it's just really really good versus the grineer and the armor to corrupt it and it pretty much one tap so do you love a grineer once you get Arvind scope up because at that point your crit is very reliable and you're going to create on basically every shot and unsurprisingly the same thing will happen to the infested as well though most of the time for the infested I do prefer the gas build because the amount of AoE take damage you can get from a crate headshot is ridiculous though you have to be kind of careful not to proc it on yourself because it really really hurts and finally we have the corpus where the gas build is just hilarious the damage oh the damage it's so good and now we come to the conclusion so what do I actually think about the common axe well I am conflicted my dear viewer on one hand I hate the terrible reload time I am NOT a big fan of self damage you probably know that if you watch my articles and the fire rate when you're scoped in all the way is just really low but on the other I am really happy with the way they tackled a stages base type rifle because when I first saw the stats I'm going to homeboy here we go again but it's actually pretty good I like it and I'm overall leaning more towards liking it than disliking it because even though I'm not a big fan of self damage it is a sniper rifle so you're mostly going to be shooting at things that are pretty far away and the projectile fly Stretch ahead too so there is no fall-off it's not bouncing around so it's overall much harder to actually hit yourself with it and even though the reload time is pretty damn bad the 20 round magazine makes it well not as bad so oh no I'm going to give the Komorex at thumbs up it is just a cool and unique sniper rifle and you should definitely check it out and that is pretty much all I wanted to say So, I thank you very much for reading. I hope you enjoyed the article and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
