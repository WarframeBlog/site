Hey guys and welcome to another Warframe article. Today I finally want to show you how to defeat an Eidolon Teralyst in a very fast and efficient way.

So, without further ado, let's begin with the basics!

First of all, let's talk about the abilities and how to damage an [Eidolon](https://warframeblog.com/eidolons-drop-arcane-enhancements/)Â because you can't just use your regular weapons against him, not yet! In order to use your weapons against him, you have to take down his Shields. That is only possible by using your operator&#8230;

Amps that I recommend you to use the T3 Amp with its Shwaak Prism perfect if you want to hit multiple hitboxes of the [Eidolon](https://warframeblog.com/spawn-defeat-gantulyst-hydrolyst/).. or the T4 Amp the last one from Onkko. Higher Amps are of course stronger, but to be honest, even the standard T1 Amp is more than enough, because you're in a group of 4 people anyways.

The abilities of Eidolon Teralyst are very predictable and you are able to dodge every ability by using your Void Mode (crouch). Making yourself untargetable is a very important part later on, so keep that in mind.

So, how do you defeat an Eidolon Teralyst alone, or in a group of 4 people? There are 3 different endings and 2 ways to defeat him, so let's start with number one.

<img src="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-kill-teralyst-in-warframe-1024x583.jpg" title="How to kill an Eidolon Teralyst in Warframe" alt="Basic way to defeat an Eidolon Teralyst" width="750" height="427" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1372" srcset="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-kill-teralyst-in-warframe-1024x583.jpg 1024w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-kill-teralyst-in-warframe-300x171.jpg 300w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-kill-teralyst-in-warframe-768x437.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />

The first step, take down the Shield with your Operator. The Shield is the most annoying part and takes a lot of time. It is very important that your allies help you. Keep dodging and recharge your energy if needed. Kavats can improve your Amp damage output by a lot, especially the Smeeta Kavat with its amazing crit buff. Sadly, it's RNG based ability.

Once you took down his Shield, the Eidolon is finally vulnerable. Now it's your time to destroy one of his 4 limbs. A Chroma is the best option for that because he can pretty much 1 hit a limb.

Destroying a limb will always drop an Exceptional Sentient Core, so be sure to pick them up. He will also send out many Magnetic waves in a radius of around 65m, run out of the radius or protect yourself with the Void Mode. After that Eidolon Teralyst disappears and spawns randomly on the map in a pond or lake.

Once you found the Teralyst, you have to repeat the step over and over again. In total, he will disappear 3 times(destroying 3 limbs). After destroying the 4th and last limb, the Teralyst drops on the ground, screaming for help. A lot of little sentients called Vomvalyst are spawning and trying to heal the Eidolon itself, kill as many as you can.

After a short amount of time, he stands up and you can simply kill him and you are able to collect his loot.

So, that's it for today! How to get better loots and better results in terms of efficiency, I will show you next time. See ya!
