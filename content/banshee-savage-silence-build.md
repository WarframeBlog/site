Hey guys and today we're going to take a look at Banshee and Banshee Prime specifically the Banshee Savage Silence Build which is my favorite [focus farming](https://warframeblog.com/how-to-farm-focus-points/) setup because it's actually fun to use. It's nice and fast..<!--more-->

Besides Banshee Savage Silence Build you might be interested in others builds: the [Banshee Resonance Build](https://warframeblog.com/banshee-resonance-build/) and the [Banshee Resonating Quake Build](https://warframeblog.com/banshee-resonating-quake-build/).

So, an aura mod that I'm using for the Banshee Savage Silence Build is Energy Siphon but you can use whatever you want and since Banshee comes with a V polarity in the aura slot, I would probably recommend Steel Charge because this is a melee build and Steel Charge will increase your melee damage if you don't want to forma the aura slot but it is kind of up to you, auras are very subjective.

Then in the Exilus slot, I'm using Rush for more sprint speed because this is a focus farming build, so you want to be nice, fast and efficient. After that, I'm using Prime Continuity and Augur Message for some extra duration so that Silence actually lasts a decent amount of time and I'm using Enemy Sense for a ton of enemy radar. Now, I don't really use this to see if the enemies are alerted or not. I don't really care about that with this Banshee build. I mostly just use it just to see where the enemies are.

Then I slapped on Primed Vigor, but this is a very much unnecessary because the vast majority of enemies will be crowd control and dead long before they have a chance to hit you so you can literally slap on whatever you want in there. And since this is a Savage Silence build, we're going to slap on the Savage Silence augment mod, which would increase our finished damage by 300% when we have silence up.

Now, this final part where I have Augur Reach, Stretch and Cunning Drift is something you will have to play around with because depending on how you play and what kind of weapon you're using, you want the different amounts of range, and this is because of how silence works. It doesn't crowd control the enemy for the entire duration. There's only a brief period in the beginning where the enemies will be holding their head in kinda spazzing around. The idea here is that you don't want to have too much range so that by the time you get to the enemies, they've already snapped out of the initial crowd control, but you also don't want to have too little range to where if you run into a room the enemies on the other side, we'll see you and get alerted. So, as I've said already, the amount of range you want to use here is up to you because if you're going really fast, you can have far more range than someone who's going a little bit slower.

And there really isn't much else to say about this Banshee Savage Silence Build. It's just a really fun and fast way to farm focus. It's not as efficient as [Equinox](https://warframeblog.com/equinox-focus-farm-build/) who can easily give this stealth multiplier going throw the entire mission because every now and then you will just alerting enemy for whatever reason, you can win some lose some, but overall it is far more fun than any of the other focus farming builds that I've tried because it's very fast and active. So, if you're like me and you prefer faster builds who genuinely just don't want to sit on Hydron and spam quake, this is definitely something you should try out.

So, that’s pretty much it for the Banshee Savage Silence Build. I thank you very much for reading. I hope you’ve enjoyed the article and it was helpful and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
