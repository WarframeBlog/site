Hello everyone. Let&#8217;s talk about season one of the Netflix Original &#8211; GLOW.<!--more-->

## What is GLOW about?

GLOW tells the story of the making of gorgeous ladies of wrestling or GLOW, a TV show about female wrestlers kind of like a low-budget all-female WWE or WWF, I don&#8217;t really know the differences. GLOW was a real thing back in like 1985. I don&#8217;t know how accurate the show is. I do know it&#8217;s a fictionalization about the origins of the show. So, I don&#8217;t know how well it echoes what really happened but that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re here to talk about. A story takes place in the 80s and it mainly follows Ruth Wilder.

She&#8217;s trying to make it as an actress but she mainly does free plays. She does lots and lots of auditions but they never really pan out but she keeps going. She&#8217;s not really the type to give up. Ruth&#8217;s best friends Debbie used to play a role on a successful soap opera and had a bit more success as an actress but now she&#8217;s a stay-at-home mom. While Ruth and Debbie are best friends something happens to separate them. There&#8217;s a big fight. There&#8217;s a crisis in their relationship and they pretty much go their separate ways. Ruth eventually auditions for GLOW, the wrestling show, and after a chain of entertaining but intense events Ruth and Debbie get into a situation where they have to work together or at least try to work together on the show. GLOW is not just about Ruth and Debbie and their relationship. The focus is about the wrestling show and the women who participated and how they all try to make this thing work. And of course, they all have their own personal stories. The stories just told from Ruth&#8217;s perspective and she also has to deal with the whole Debbie situation. This is a super quick watch, ten episodes about 30 minutes each.

## GLOW review

It&#8217;s a fun quick watch. For the first half of the season, my issue was that not a whole lot happens in each episode. So, the episodes were fun and went by fast and Alison Brie does a really good job but the story didn&#8217;t really go anywhere for a few episode. The show gets moving when GLOW becomes a thing. That&#8217;s where things pick up the show becomes more fun and the characters become more interested. That&#8217;s also when the show starts feeling with more interesting things. This all takes place in the 80s. So, Reagan is president, The Cold War is still a thing, and sexism and racism are all very casual with little to no awareness of it. And this being a wrestling show where part of the appeal is to see women wrestle in revealing outfits. The show does sort of have commentary about it. You won&#8217;t find any speeches about the objectification of women but through the characters, the story does show you how women were treated you know back when America was great I guess. Sorry, I should not have taken it there but the character used for this mainly is the director of GLOW whose whole thing is.. He&#8217;s not a bad guy. He&#8217;s just a drunk and incredibly sexist.

This is not at all a preachy show. It&#8217;s a fun interesting story and I feel that they handle all that kind of stuff pretty well. Something weird that this show tries to do is that they try to sell us on roof being like plain and real being like not TV pretty. She&#8217;s often portrayed as the ugly one or the one that no one should want. And it&#8217;s all part of her character but it&#8217;s always weird and doesn&#8217;t really work because like she&#8217;s obviously Alison Brie and she&#8217;s obviously beautiful. It doesn&#8217;t hurt the story or the show in any way. I just felt it was weird. GLOW is an entirely and completely predictable show. You know exactly what&#8217;s going to happen at any given moment. It ends exactly like you think it&#8217;s going to but this is a throwback to this type of story the underdog rising and all of that. And they nail it. They nailed the 80s look and feel of the show, the music, everything. I don&#8217;t think you will expect to gasp &#8211; &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe they did that&#8221;. It&#8217;s not that type of show. I really like that this show is not ironic. It&#8217;s not a parody of the 80s and this type of story. It is one.. they use music for example in the same way they do in movies made in the 80s but the show didn&#8217;t feel cheesy to me. The performance is really good, Alison Brie especially is fantastic. And even though the story is predictable it&#8217;s still fun and engaging to go through this journey with these characters.

## Should you watch GLOW?

I had a lot of fun with GLOW. It&#8217;s a quick show to watch over the weekend. I feel that they pulled off exactly what they were going for much like Stranger Things did. I&#8217;m not saying that this show is as good as Stranger Things. These are not really comparable shows. They&#8217;re very different. I&#8217;m just saying that both of these shows successfully did the things that they set out to do.
