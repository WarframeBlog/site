Hey guys. And today we're going to start a new Frost Builds series.<!--more-->

Now, the thing about Frost is that he's an extremely versatile frame. You can build him in a thousand different ways and there's a lot of room for tweaking on your end, so please don't take it as if these builds were set in stone.
  
You can of course copy builds exactly and it's going to work just fine, but I would think about these Frost Builds as more of an inspiration for your own builds because you can play around with different values: duration, efficiency, range, and even strength. And as long as you don't stray too far away from the original idea of these builds, it should still work. You're not going to break it.

## Frost Ice Wave Build

So, let's started off with build number one, which focuses on the Ice Wave Impedance Augment - Frost Ice Wave Build. It's running Stand United as its Aura, which is a very nice defensive option if you don't want to run something like Corrosive Projection for the armor reduction, even Energy Siphon for the extra energy. And it gives you and your party a 25.5% increase to their armor. Now I am then running Intensify which increases the damage of Ice Wave and this is mostly for low to mid levels because it actually does a decent amount of damage and you're going to one shot the Cannon Fodder units until like level 30.

I am then running Primed Continuity and if you don't have the primed version, the regular one is just fine and this is just to increase the duration of the icy floor that's left behind by the Ice Wave Impedance Augment. Then I want you to add some range, so I finally bought Auger Reach. I'm also adding Cunning Drift and Stretch to increase the range in the width of the Ice Wave so we can cover a massive area with each cast. This is fantastic, especially for bigger tilesets. We're then going to add Ice Wave Impedance, which the augment for Ice Wave that makes it leave behind ice on the ground whenever you cast it. And this is fantastic because it slows enemies down quite a bit and it's amazing for crowd control. We're then going to add Streamline to make Ice Wave a little bit cheaper because it's kind of expensive and we wanted to be casting it fairly often. And we are going to top it off with Steel Fiber for some extra armor and Vitality for more health and this leaves us with a very nice effective health pull, which when combined with the crowd control from Ice Wave Impedance, makes it so that we can survive quite a lot.

## How doesÂ Frost Ice Wave Build perform?

Now, while this setup is fantastic for exterminates, captures, sabotage, and in general no endless missions because it's a very mobile. I absolutely adore it in survival missions. It is just stupid amounts of fun to pick a room bunker down, cover the entire floor in ice and slow everything down to a crawl. Now, it is pretty power hungry, so unless you're running with something like [Trinity](https://warframeblog.com/trinity-energy-vampire-build/) or Harrow or you have Zenurik Focus School, you mostly want to use this for crowd control and not damage. But if you do have one of those things with you, you can easily use it to do damage because as I said already, it will one-shot most of the Karen for the units up to sort of level 30, and that's a really cool, especially with the amount of range that we have on this because you can pretty much just clear an entire room with a single cast. The best thing about this though is that even if you run into a beefier unit, that's not going to go down in one cast or the enemies are generally too high level for you to take them down with this, it is still providing a massive amount of crowd control. It also makes it much easier for you to headshots the enemies because they're simply not moving as fast, which makes it much easier to predict what they're going to do.

That's pretty much it for the Frost Ice Wave Build. So, I'll see you in the next article of the Frost [Builds](https://warframeblog.com/warframe-builds/) series and we'll check out [Frost Snow Globe Build](https://warframeblog.com/frost-snow-globe-build/). Bye-Bye.
