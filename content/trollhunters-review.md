Trollhunters was created by Guillermo del Toro and tells the story of Jim Lake &#8211; a 15-year-old boy who finds a magical amulet and becomes the Trollhunter. As the Trollhunter Jim has to protect both the troll world and the human world from all kinds of magical threats. Jim is joined by a group of his friends both human and troll and a few other species and the show follows them as they tackle both challenges like fighting monsters and just the typical nightmare of being in high school. This show was recommended to me by you guys a couple of weeks ago so I watched it over the course of a week and a half. So, let&#8217;s get into it.

## Trollhunters review

This show has a lot of tropes or constructs that you&#8217;ll probably be familiar with: the fantasy of a kid who gets magical powers, the old and wise mentor, the funny sidekick friend, the love interest, the big brute who&#8217;s actually sweet.. you get the point. The thing is I didn&#8217;t mind any of it because all of it was super well done. I kept thinking about Stranger Things when I was watching this. These are obviously very different shows but both of them capture the excitement and wonder of a kid living out these fantasies. I think the best way I can describe it is that Trollhunters just has a lot of heart. The voice acting I thought was spectacular in this show especially the unfortunately late Anton Yelchin as Jim and Kelsey Grammer as Blinky. The rest of the cast did a great job as well but those two were just kind of like a level above. The animation was great. There&#8217;s some really clever camerawork and generally, I just loved how things were visualized. I think they got innovative with how they chose to show magic and all the supernatural stuff. They took a lot of familiar fantasy things and gave them a fresh new spin. A character and an environment design especially was a lot of fun. There are a lot of different types of creatures and weapons and places in the show and every just looks great. At no point does it feel like they cut back on something.

Trollhunters is geared for a very wide audience. I imagine mostly geeks like myself and kids. So, the action isn&#8217;t gory but it is exciting. I was actually surprised by how exciting the action in this show is. Regardless of if it&#8217;s a kids show or not the fight scenes were pretty awesome. The story is super straightforward and easy to follow but there&#8217;s a surprising amount of character depth in this show for both the good and the bad guys. The relationships between the characters were also surprisingly fleshed outю I think this is a very kid-friendly show but there is some violence and there are characters who sort of die. Аor me this is the type of show that I think I&#8217;d have a blast watching with my nephews and nieces but you know just be aware of that so you won&#8217;t be caught off guard if you&#8217;re gonna watch this with a kid. If I had to point out something that I didn&#8217;t like as much it&#8217;ll probably be the fact that it&#8217;s a bit too long. It&#8217;s 26 episodes about 20 minutes each. The episodes fly by but there is some filler in this show very little though. The episodes are mostly really great.

## Should you watch Trollhunters?

I had a great time with Trollhunters. It&#8217;s a fun fantasy with a lot of heart. I found myself actually caring about the characters and genuinely interested to see what happens next. It&#8217;s a super family-friendly show. It&#8217;s expertly animated and voice acted and just generally if you&#8217;ve been watching a lot of heavy dark TV shows lately and you&#8217;re just looking for something that&#8217;s bright and fun that still has a good story I&#8217;d say check out Trollhunters.
