Hello everyone and welcome to another Warframe build article. Today we’re gonna take a quick look at the Fluctus - an Archwing primary weapon which fires a wave of energy.<!--more-->

Last week Corpus finally finished building their [Razorback](/the-razorbacks-armada-event/ "Razorback Armada Guide") and unleashed it onto the Solar System. And if you wanted to fight the Razorback and get parts for Gorgon Wraith you have to do archwing to farm cryptographic ALU to build a cipher which would then unlock the mission. So I started farming the ALUs and I was bored because I was flying around with my Imperator which is the most boring weapon ever and I was just like "I'm just here because I have to do this otherwise I can't get the ALUs. I can't build the cipher and I can't fight the Razorback". 

However, as I did more and more missions and I farm more and more ALUs I started to notice that in almost every mission someone was flying around with this crazy-ass arbalist firing of these horizontal plasma beams and it looked like a genuinely fun weapon to use. And it was the Fluctus. 

## Fluctus Stats
Anyway the Fluctus is pinpoint accurate. It has 15% crit chance, 2.0x multiplier, and 10% status chance. It does 200 damage with each shot: 140 is slash, 40 is impact, and 20 is puncture. It fires up to 5 rounds per second with 25 rounds in the magazine.

## How to get and build Fluctus
The Fluctus is also fairly easy to get you just get the blueprint from the Tenno Lab in your dojo. And to build the Fluctus you will have to put 45,000 credits, two Argon Crystals. And also you're gonna have to get the Barrel, Stock, and Limbs which you get from syndicates for 20,000 standing or you can also buy them from other players using platinum. And you get the Barrel from Cephalon Suda, you get the Stock from Steel Meridian, and you can get the Limbs from Red Veil. And that's it. That's all you need.

## Fluctus Build
Now the Fluctus Build I went for is two forma build where I’ve added two V. And the mods I’m running are Rubedo-Lined Barrel for damage, Dual Rounds for multishot, Parallax Scope for critical chance, and Hollowed Bullets for critical damage. Then to extend the magazine a little bit I added Magazine Extension which gives me 40 rounds instead of 25. 

Also I've combined that with Shell Rush which increases the speed at which the magazine charges its ammo because without these two or with just one of them I was running out of ammo far too often and I just had to wait around which I didn't really like. After that I added Polar Magazine and Combustion Rounds for blast damage which made the most sense for me because it seems like you're fighting a lot of machinery and blast is really strong versus machinery.

Overall, I would recommend the Fluctus to anyone especially to people that never tried anything other than the Imperator and don't really like archwing since you may be in a similar situation to the one I was in where I wouldn't get anything other than the Imperator because I thought I didn't like archwing but it was actually the Imperator since it's boring and terrible. So definitely try it out!. And that's pretty much it for the Fluctus Build article. I thank you very much for reading and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
