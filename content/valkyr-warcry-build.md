Hey guys and today we’re gonna take a look at the Valkyr Warcry Build.<!--more-->

So, the aura I am using for Valkyr Warcry Build is Steel Charge for more melee damage and I'm using Rush in my exilus slot for more sprint speed because sprint speed with melee weapons, especially with some of them, is super-fun. Then I'm using Blind Rage for a big chunk of power strength for stronger Warcry and the negative efficiency doesn't matter here because we are using the Eternal War augment which makes so that if you have Warcry active whenever you kill an enemy with a melee weapon it will add additional duration to your Warcry. And this combined with Primed Continuity allows you to stack your Warcry up to 40 seconds in duration. So, you basically just turn it on at the start of the mission and you keep it up throughout the entire thing.

After that, I have Vitality and Gladiator Resolve for a ton of health, Steel Fiber and Gladiator Aegis for a ton of armor and this also gives you the added benefit of the minute blood rush effect from the Gladiator set bonus. And finally, I have a Hunter Adrenaline for some energy generation. And Hunter Adrenaline is here so that I always have full energy and I can always jump into Hysteria if things get a little bit nasty.

{{< image title="Hirudo Build for Warcry Build" alt="Melee build to use with Valkyr Warcry" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/hirudo-warcry-build-1024x348.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/hirudo-warcry-build-1024x348.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/hirudo-warcry-build-300x102.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/hirudo-warcry-build-768x261.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/hirudo-warcry-build.png 1596w">}}

Now, while you can very much use this Valkyr Build with any melee weapon in the game and it's gonna be just fine. If you want to do super high-level stuff I would either recommend something like the Hirudo which will possibly heal you as you attack enemies. But if you don't have or like Hirudo you can simply pick a status weapon with a Healing Return which is also really good with a build like this.

## Valkyr Warcry Build Arcanes

{{< image title="Valkyr Warcry Build Arcanes" alt="Arcanes that will be a good addition to Valkyr Warcry Build" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/valkyr-warcry-build-arcanes-1024x576.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/valkyr-warcry-build-arcanes-1024x576.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/valkyr-warcry-build-arcanes-300x169.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/valkyr-warcry-build-arcanes-768x432.png 768w">}}

And finally, if you really want to pimp this Valkyr Build out I would personally use Arcane Fury for a 10% chance on a crit to increase melee damage by 120% for 12 seconds and Arcane Strike which gives your hits a 10% chance to increase your melee attack speed by 40% for 12 seconds.

The Valkyr Warcry Build is just crazy and I love it. You get an insane amount of attack speed bonus from Warcry with Blind Rage and which turns you into this violent ball of pain that's just zooming around the level and killing everything. And if you combo this with something like the Hirudo or a status weapon with Healing Return the only way you're ever gonna die is if you just straight up get one shot which is pretty hard because with Warcry up you have well over 3000 armor so you don't take a lot of damage even from high-level like bombards and stuff. And this is why I don't use the Valkyr Hysteria Build too much because there is a very little content in the game that this build cannot handle.

This Valkyr Build is just really fun and I would definitely recommend you try it out. It's kinda like the Mirage for melee weapons because you can get so much attack speed from just Warcry and a lot of weapons especially certain types of weapons get way more fun with a ton of attack speed. So, if you want a solid and fun melee setup this is definitely the way to go in my opinion and you can easily push this up to sort of level 150 to 200 basically up until you start getting one shot. That's where this Valkyr Build kind of falls off.

And that’s pretty much it for the Valkyr Warcry Build. Now, of course, this build will work on Valkyr Prime as well as the standard version. It may just require a little bit of forma on the regular Valkyr. And I thank you very much for reading. I hope you’ve enjoyed the article and it was helpful and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
