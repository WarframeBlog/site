<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Kogake Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-mirage-prime/" title="How To Get Mirage Prime">Mirage Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-akbolto-prime/" title="How To Get Akbolto Prime">Akbolto Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Kogake Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Kogake Prime from the drop table. So, currently Kogake Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Kogake Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Kogake Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Axi K4, Meso M3, Axi V7, Axi C4, Axi P1</b> that drop Kogake Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Meso K1, Neo K1, Neo K2, Lith K2</b> that drop Kogake Prime Gauntlet </li>  <li> <b>Meso M2, Axi A3, Axi T2, Lith L1, Neo G1</b> that drop Kogake Prime Boot </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Kogake Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Kogake Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Kogake Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Kogake Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
