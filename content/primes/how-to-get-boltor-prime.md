<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Boltor Prime</strong> along with the Ankyros Prime and the Rhino Prime have emerged from the Prime Vault. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Boltor Prime and where you can farm these relics. </p><!--more--><h2>Boltor Prime Relics</h2><p>So, Boltor Prime parts scattered across four different relics:</p><ul><li><b>Axi S3</b> that drops Boltor Prime Stock</li><li><b>Neo R1</b> that drops Boltor Prime Receiver</li><li><b>Lith B4</b> that drops Boltor Prime Blueprint</li><li><b>Meso N6</b> that drops Boltor Prime Barrel</li></ul><h2>Boltor Prime Relics Farming</h2><h3>How To Get Boltor Prime Stock Relics</h3><p>You can obtain <b>Axi S3 Relics</b> from Aten - a mobile defense mission or Marduk - a sabotage mission. Both of them have a chance to drop a Neo relic as well.</p><h3>How To Get Boltor Prime Receiver Relics</h3><p>For <b>Neo R1 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Belenus</b> in the Void. Belenus is a straightforward defense mission best attempted with a team and you should be able to get two Neo relics in 10 waves most of the time(or one Meso and one Neo).</p><h3>How To Get Boltor Prime Blueprint Relics</h3><p>For <strong>farming Lith B4 Relics</strong> the <b>Heppit</b> mission in the Void is a great option. It's a quick capture mission which you can repeat pretty quickly.</p><h3>How To Get Boltor Prime Barrel Relics</h3><p>In order to farm <b>Meso N6 Relics</b>, I would recommend <b>Ukko</b> in the Void. It's a capture and can be completed really quickly.</p><p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Boltor Prime relics.</p><p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Boltor Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
