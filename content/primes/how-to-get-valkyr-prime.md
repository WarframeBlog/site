<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Valkyr Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-cernos-prime/" title="How To Get Cernos Prime">Cernos Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-venka-prime/" title="How To Get Venka Prime">Venka Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Valkyr Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Valkyr Prime from the drop table. So, currently Valkyr Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Valkyr Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Valkyr Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Lith T1, Lith S6, Meso D2, Meso V4, Meso C2, Neo N7</b> that drop Valkyr Prime Neuroptics Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Neo V7, Axi V6, Axi V5</b> that drop Valkyr Prime Chassis Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Lith V3, Lith V5, Meso V3</b> that drop Valkyr Prime Systems Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Neo K1, Lith T2, Lith A2, Axi V7, Lith N3, Meso S3, Meso S6</b> that drop Valkyr Prime Blueprint </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Valkyr Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Valkyr Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Valkyr Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Valkyr Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
