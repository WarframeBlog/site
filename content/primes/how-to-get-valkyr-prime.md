<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Valkyr Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-cernos-prime/" title="How To Get Cernos Prime">Cernos Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-venka-prime/" title="How To Get Venka Prime">Venka Prime</a> have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Valkyr Prime and where you can farm these relics.</p><!--more--> <h2>Valkyr Prime Relics</h2> <p>So, Valkyr Prime parts scattered across six different relics:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Meso N8, Lith C5</b> that drop Valkyr Prime Neuroptics Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Lith V6</b> that drops Valkyr Prime Chassis Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Axi V9</b> that drops Valkyr Prime Systems Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Meso N8, Axi V9</b> that drop Valkyr Prime Blueprint </li>  </ul> <h2>Valkyr Prime Relics Farming</h2> <p>Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Valkyr Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Valkyr Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.</p>  <h3>How To Get Valkyr Prime Neuroptics Blueprint Relics</h3>     <p>For <strong>farming Lith C5 Relics</strong> the <b>Hepit mission in the Void</b> is a great option. It's a quick capture mission which you can repeat pretty quickly.</p>        <p>In order to farm <b>Meso N8 Relics</b>, I would recommend <b>Ukko in the Void</b>. It's a capture mission and can be completed really quickly.</p>      <h3>How To Get Valkyr Prime Chassis Blueprint Relics</h3>    <p>   You    can get it by opening <b>Lith V6</b> Relics. To farm these relics, I suggest you go to the same mission which I've already mentioned in <em>How To Get Valkyr Prime Neuroptics Blueprint Relics</em> section.</p>    <h3>How To Get Valkyr Prime Systems Blueprint Relics</h3>     <p>You can obtain <b>Axi V9</b> Relics from Marduk - a sabotage mission. This mission has a chance to drop Neo relics as well.</p>      <h3>How To Get Valkyr Prime Blueprint Relics</h3>    <p>   You    can get it by opening <b>Axi V9</b> Relics. To farm these relics, I suggest you go to the same mission which I've already mentioned in <em>How To Get Valkyr Prime Systems Blueprint Relics</em> section.</p>     <p>    Besides that, you   can get it by opening <b>Meso N8</b> Relics. To farm these relics, I suggest you go to the same mission which I've already mentioned in <em>How To Get Valkyr Prime Neuroptics Blueprint Relics</em> section.</p>     <h2>Farming Valkyr Prime Relics in Bounties</h2> <p>Bounties are a fantastic way to get relics as well. You can take up the bounties from Cetus or <a href="/fortuna/" title="Warframe Fortuna">Fortuna</a>. Both will yield almost similar results.    With <b>tier three bounties</b> granting <b>Meso N8 relics</b> ,          <b>tier two bounties</b> granting <b>Lith V6,Lith C5 relics</b>,        <b>tier five bounties</b> granting <b>Axi V9 relics</b>,       and <b>tier one bounties</b> dropping <b>Lith V6 relics</b>.      <p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Valkyr Prime relics.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Valkyr Prime Relics Farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
