<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Ankyros Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-rhino-prime/" title="How To Get Rhino Prime">Rhino Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-boltor-prime/" title="How To Get Boltor Prime">Boltor Prime</a> have emerged from the Prime Vault. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Ankyros Prime and where you can farm these relics.</p><!--more--> <h2>Ankyros Prime Relics</h2> <p>So, Ankyros Prime parts scattered across three different relics:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Axi S3</b> that drops Ankyros Prime Blade </li>  <li> <b>Neo R1</b> that drops Ankyros Prime Gauntlet </li>  <li> <b>Lith B4</b> that drops Ankyros Prime Blueprint </li>  </ul> <h2>Ankyros Prime Relics Farming</h2> <p>Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Ankyros Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Ankyros Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.</p>  <h3>How To Get Ankyros Prime Blueprint Relics</h3>     <p>For <strong>farming Lith B4 Relics</strong> the <b>Hepit mission in the Void</b> is a great option. It's a quick capture mission which you can repeat pretty quickly.</p>     <h3>How To Get Ankyros Prime Blade Relics</h3>     <p>You can obtain <b>Axi S3</b> Relics from Marduk - a sabotage mission. This mission has a chance to drop Neo relics as well.</p>     <h3>How To Get Ankyros Prime Gauntlet Relics</h3>     <p>For <b>Neo R1 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Belenus in the Void</b>. Belenus is a straightforward defense mission best attempted with a team and you should be able to get two Neo relics in ten waves most of the time(or one Meso and one Neo).</p>     <p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Ankyros Prime relics.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Ankyros Prime Relics Farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
