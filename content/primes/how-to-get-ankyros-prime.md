<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Ankyros Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-rhino-prime/" title="How To Get Rhino Prime">Rhino Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-boltor-prime/" title="How To Get Boltor Prime">Boltor Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Ankyros Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Ankyros Prime from the drop table. So, currently Ankyros Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Ankyros Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Ankyros Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Axi S3, Axi R1</b> that drop Ankyros Prime Blade </li>  <li> <b>Meso M1, Neo R1</b> that drop Ankyros Prime Gauntlet </li>  <li> <b>Lith B1, Lith B4</b> that drop Ankyros Prime Blueprint </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Ankyros Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Ankyros Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Ankyros Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Ankyros Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
