<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Ankyros Prime</strong> along with the Rhino Prime and the Boltor Prime have emerged from the Prime Vault. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Ankyros Prime and where you can farm these relics. </p><!--more--><h2>Ankyros Prime Relics</h2><p>So, Ankyros Prime parts scattered across three different relics:</p><ul><li><b>Axi S3</b> that drops Ankyros Prime Blade</li><li><b>Lith B4</b> that drops Ankyros Prime Blueprint</li><li><b>Neo R1</b> that drops Ankyros Prime Gauntlet</li></ul><h2>Ankyros Prime Relics Farming</h2><h3>How To Get Ankyros Prime Blade Relics</h3><p>You can obtain <b>Axi S3 Relics</b> from Aten - a mobile defense mission or Marduk - a sabotage mission. Both of them have a chance to drop a Neo relic as well.</p><h3>How To Get Ankyros Prime Blueprint Relics</h3><p>For <strong>farming Lith B4 Relics</strong> the <b>Heppit</b> mission in the Void is a great option. It's a quick capture mission which you can repeat pretty quickly.</p><h3>How To Get Ankyros Prime Gauntlet Relics</h3><p>For <b>Neo R1 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Belenus</b> in the Void. Belenus is a straightforward defense mission best attempted with a team and you should be able to get two Neo relics in 10 waves most of the time(or one Meso and one Neo).</p><p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Ankyros Prime relics.</p><p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Ankyros Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
