Hey guys. And the Mesa Prime along with Akjagara Prime and [Rede﻿emer Prime﻿](/primes/how-to-get-redeemer-prime/ "How To Get Redeemer Prime") have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Mesa Prime and where you can farm these relics. <!--more-->

## Mesa Prime Relics
So, [Mesa](/warframes/mesa/ "Warframe Mesa") Prime parts scattered across four different relics:

* <b>Lith M3 relic</b> that drops the Mesa Prime Neuroprtics as a rare drop
* <b>Neo M2 relic</b> that drops the Mesa Prime Systems as a rare drop
* <b>Neo Z2 relic</b> that drops the Mesa Prime Blueprint as an uncommon drop
* <b>Axi H4 relic</b> that drops the Mesa Prime Chassis as a common drop

## Mesa Prime Relics Farming
Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Mesa Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Mesa Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.

### How To Get Mesa Prime Neuroprtics relics
So, for <strong>farming Lith relics</strong> the <b>Orokin Derelict Defense</b> mission is a great option. ODD is a straightforward defense mission that you can even solo with banshee and you should be able to get two Lith relics in 10 waves most of the time.

### How To Get Mesa Prime Systems & Blueprint relics
For <b>Neo relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Hydron on Sedna</b>. It is the fastest way to farm for Neo relics because Neo relics drop every 5 rounds. Also, it worth mentioned that Hydron is the best area to level up your Warframe and weapons. So, don't forget to bring alongside your weapons that you want to level up.

### How To Get Mesa Prime Chassis relics
For <b>Axi relics farming</b> I would recommend <b>Xini on Eris</b>. It's an interception mission that's pretty straightforward. The first two rounds drop Neo relics and rounds 3 and 4 regularly dropping Axi relics. Optimally you want to stay four rounds before extracting.

Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for [Neurodes](/warframe-neurodes-farming/ "Warframe Neurodes Farming
").

## Farming Mesa Prime Relics in the Void
Another way to farm Mesa Prime relics is Void missions. Go with Hepit(Capture mission) as your source of Lith relics and Aten(mobile defense mission) or Marduk(sabotage mission) as your Neo and Axi relics places to farm. 

## Farming Mesa Prime Relics in Bounties
Bounties are a fantastic way to get relics as well. You can take up the bounties from Cetus of [Fortuna](/fortuna/ "Warframe Fortuna") both will yield similar results. With tier 2 bounties granting Lith relics, tier 4 bounties granting Neo relics, and tier 5 bounties granting Axi relics.

## Farming Mesa Prime Relics in Sanctuary Onslaught
Also, you can get Mesa Prime relics by playing [Sanctuary Onslaught mode](/sanctuary-onslaught-guide/ "Sanctuary Onslaught Guide"). Upon completing the normal version of Sanctuary Onslaught you will be rewarded with Lith relics on rotation A and Neo relics on rotation C. And the Elite Sanctuary Onslaught will reward you with Lith relics on rotation A, Neo relics on rotation B, and Axi relics on rotation C.

Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Mesa Prime relics.

And that’s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Mesa Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck farming the ultimate gunslinger. Bye-bye.
