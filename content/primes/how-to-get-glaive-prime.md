<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Glaive Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-ember-prime/" title="How To Get Ember Prime">Ember Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-sicarus-prime/" title="How To Get Sicarus Prime">Sicarus Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Glaive Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Glaive Prime from the drop table. So, currently Glaive Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Glaive Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Glaive Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Axi L1, Axi E1</b> that drop Glaive Prime Blade </li>  <li> <b>Neo S5, Meso F3</b> that drop Glaive Prime Disc </li>  <li> <b>Lith G1, Lith G2</b> that drop Glaive Prime Blueprint </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Glaive Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Glaive Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Glaive Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Glaive Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
