<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Equinox Prime</strong> along with Tipedo Prime and Stradavar Prime have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Equinox Prime and where you can farm these relics. </p><!--more--><h2>Equinox Prime Relics</h2><p>So, Equinox Prime parts scattered across four different relics:</p><ul><li><b>Axi K5</b> that drops Equinox Prime Blueprint</li><li><b>Lith M4</b> that drops Equinox Prime Chassis Blueprint</li><li><b>Meso E2</b> that drops Equinox Prime Systems Blueprint</li><li><b>Meso M3</b> that drops Equinox Prime Neuroptics Blueprint</li></ul><h2>Equinox Prime Relics Farming</h2><p>Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Equinox Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Equinox Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.</p><h3>How To Get Equinox Prime System &amp; Neuroptics Relics</h3><p>In order to farm <b>Meso E2 / Meso M3 Relics</b>, I would recommend <b>IO on Jupiter</b>. This mission can be completed really quickly and with some luck, you should be able to get two Meso relics in 10 waves.</p><h3>How To Get Equinox Prime Blueprint Relics</h3><p>For <b>Axi K5 Relics farming</b> I would recommend <b>Xini on Eris</b>. It's an interception mission that's pretty straightforward. The first two rounds drop Neo relics and rounds 3 and 4 regularly dropping Axi relics. Optimally you want to stay four rounds before extracting.</p><p>Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for [Neurodes](/warframe-neurodes-farming/ "Warframe Neurodes Farming").</p><h3>How To Get Equinox Prime Chassis Relics</h3><p>For <strong>farming Lith M4 Relics</strong> the <b>Orokin Derelict Defense</b> mission is a great option. ODD is a straightforward defense mission that you can even solo with Banshee and you should be able to get two Lith relics in 10 waves most of the time.</p><p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Equinox Prime relics.</p><p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Equinox Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
