<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Equinox Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-tipedo-prime/" title="How To Get Tipedo Prime">Tipedo Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-stradavar-prime/" title="How To Get Stradavar Prime">Stradavar Prime</a> have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Equinox Prime and where you can farm these relics.</p><!--more--> <h2>Equinox Prime Relics</h2> <p>So, Equinox Prime parts scattered across five different relics:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Meso E2</b> that drops Equinox Prime Systems Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Axi P1, Lith M4</b> that drop Equinox Prime Chassis Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Lith L1</b> that drops Equinox Prime Neuroptics Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Meso A2</b> that drops Equinox Prime Blueprint </li>  </ul> <h2>Equinox Prime Relics Farming</h2> <p>Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Equinox Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Equinox Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.</p>  <h3>How To Get Equinox Prime Systems Blueprint &amp; Equinox Prime Blueprint Relics</h3>    <p>In order to farm <b>Meso E2/Meso A2 Relics</b> , I would recommend <b>Io on Jupiter</b>. This mission can be completed really quickly and with some luck, you should be able to get two Meso relics in 10 waves.</p>       <h3>How To Get Equinox Prime Chassis Blueprint Relics</h3>    <p>For <b>Axi P1 Relics Farming</b> I would recommend <b>Xini on Eris</b>. It's an interception mission that's pretty straightforward. The first two rounds drop Neo relics and rounds 3 and 4 regularly dropping Axi relics. Optimally you want to stay four rounds before extracting.</p> <p>Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for <a href="/warframe-neurodes-farming/" title="Warframe Neurodes Farming">Neurodes</a></p>        <p>For <strong>farming Lith M4 Relics</strong> the <b>Orokin Derelict Defense</b> mission is a great option. ODD is a straightforward defense mission that you can even solo with Banshee and you should be able to get two Lith relics in 10 waves most of the time.</p>       <h3>How To Get Equinox Prime Neuroptics Blueprint Relics</h3>    <p>   You    can get it by opening <b>Lith L1</b> Relics. To farm these relics, I suggest you go to the same mission which I've already mentioned in <em>How To Get Equinox Prime Chassis Blueprint Relics</em> section.</p>     <p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Equinox Prime relics.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Equinox Prime Relics Farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
