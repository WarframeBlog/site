<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Mirage Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-akbolto-prime/" title="How To Get Akbolto Prime">Akbolto Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-kogake-prime/" title="How To Get Kogake Prime">Kogake Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Mirage Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Mirage Prime from the drop table. So, currently Mirage Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Mirage Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Mirage Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Neo M1, Meso M2, Meso M3, Axi M1</b> that drop Mirage Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Lith W1, Neo S9, Meso H1, Axi T2, Lith Z1, Neo G1</b> that drop Mirage Prime Neuroptics Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Neo L1, Meso K2, Lith S7, Axi H4</b> that drop Mirage Prime Chassis Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Neo K2, Neo V6, Neo S12, Axi R2, Meso O2</b> that drop Mirage Prime Systems Blueprint </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Mirage Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Mirage Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Mirage Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Mirage Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
