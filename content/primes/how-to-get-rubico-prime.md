<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Rubico Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-chroma-prime/" title="How To Get Chroma Prime">Chroma Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-gram-prime/" title="How To Get Gram Prime">Gram Prime</a> have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Rubico Prime and where you can farm these relics.</p><!--more--> <h2>Rubico Prime Relics</h2> <p>So, Rubico Prime parts scattered across seven different relics:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Axi M1, Meso Z3</b> that drop Rubico Prime Barrel </li>  <li> <b>Axi L5, Meso E2</b> that drop Rubico Prime Stock </li>  <li> <b>Neo R2</b> that drops Rubico Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Lith A3, Lith K2</b> that drop Rubico Prime Receiver </li>  </ul> <h2>Rubico Prime Relics Farming</h2> <p>Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Rubico Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Rubico Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.</p>  <h3>How To Get Rubico Prime Barrel &amp; Rubico Prime Stock Relics</h3>    <p>For <b>Axi L5/Axi M1 Relics Farming</b> I would recommend <b>Xini on Eris</b>. It's an interception mission that's pretty straightforward. The first two rounds drop Neo relics and rounds 3 and 4 regularly dropping Axi relics. Optimally you want to stay four rounds before extracting.</p> <p>Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for <a href="/warframe-neurodes-farming/" title="Warframe Neurodes Farming">Neurodes</a></p>        <p>In order to farm <b>Meso Z3/Meso E2 Relics</b> , I would recommend <b>Io on Jupiter</b>. This mission can be completed really quickly and with some luck, you should be able to get two Meso relics in 10 waves.</p>       <h3>How To Get Rubico Prime Blueprint Relics</h3>    <p>For <b>Neo R2 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Hydron on Sedna</b>. It is the fastest way to farm for Neo relics because Neo relics drop every 5 rounds. Also, it worth mentioned that Hydron is the best area to level up your Warframe and weapons. So, don't forget to bring alongside your weapons that you want to level up.</p>       <h3>How To Get Rubico Prime Receiver Relics</h3>    <p>For <strong>farming Lith A3/Lith K2 Relics</strong> the <b>Orokin Derelict Defense</b> mission is a great option. ODD is a straightforward defense mission that you can even solo with Banshee and you should be able to get two Lith relics in 10 waves most of the time.</p>        <p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Rubico Prime relics.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Rubico Prime Relics Farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
