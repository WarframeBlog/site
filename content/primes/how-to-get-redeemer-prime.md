Hey guys. And the [Mesa Prime](/primes/how-to-get-mesa-prime/ "How To Get Mesa Prime") along with Akjagara Prime and Rede﻿emer Prime﻿ have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Redeemer Prime and where you can farm these relics. <!--more-->

## Redeemer Prime Relics
So, Redeemer Prime parts scattered across three different relics:

* <b>Lith B6 relic</b> that drops the Redeemer Prime Blueprint as an uncommon drop
* <b>Meso Z2 relic</b> that drops the Redeemer Prime Blade as a common drop
* <b>Axi R2 relic</b> that drops the Redeemer Prime Handle as a rare drop

## Redeemer Prime Relics Farming
Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Redeemer Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Redeemer Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.

### How To Get Redeemer Prime Blueprint relics
So, for <strong>farming Lith relics</strong> the <b>Orokin Derelict Defense</b> mission is a great option. ODD is a straightforward defense mission that you can even solo with banshee and you should be able to get two Lith relics in 10 waves most of the time.

### How To Get Redeemer Prime Blade relics
In order to farm <b>Meso relics</b>, I would recommend <b>IO on Jupiter</b>. This mission can be completed really quickly and with some luck, you should be able to get two Meso relics in 10 waves.

### How To Get Redeemer Prime Handle relics
For <b>Axi relics farming</b> I would recommend <b>Xini on Eris</b>. It's an interception mission that's pretty straightforward. The first two rounds drop Neo relics and rounds 3 and 4 regularly dropping Axi relics. Optimally you want to stay four rounds before extracting.

Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for [Neurodes](/warframe-neurodes-farming/ "Warframe Neurodes Farming
").

## Farming Redeemer Prime Relics in the Void
Another way to farm Redeemer Prime relics is Void missions. Go with Hepit(Capture mission) as your source of Lith relics, Ukko(Capture mission) as your Meso relics farm location, and Aten(mobile defense mission) or Marduk(sabotage mission) as your Axi relics places to farm. 

## Farming Redeemer Prime Relics in Bounties
Bounties are a fantastic way to get relics as well. You can take up the bounties from Cetus of [Fortuna](/fortuna/ "Warframe Fortuna") both will yield similar results. With tier 2 bounties granting Lith relics, tier 3 bounties granting Meso relics, and tier 5 bounties granting Axi relics.

## Farming Redeemer Prime Relics in Sanctuary Onslaught
Also, you can get Redeemer Prime relics by playing [Sanctuary Onslaught mode](/sanctuary-onslaught-guide/ "Sanctuary Onslaught Guide"). Upon completing the normal version of Sanctuary Onslaught you will be rewarded with Lith relics on rotation A and Meso relics on rotation B. And the Elite Sanctuary Onslaught will reward you with Lith and Meso relics on rotation A and Axi relics on rotation C.

Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Redeemer Prime relics.

And that’s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Redeemer Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck farming that long-awaited gunblade. Bye-bye.
