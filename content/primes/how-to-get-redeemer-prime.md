<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Redeemer Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-mesa-prime/" title="How To Get Mesa Prime">Mesa Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-akjagara-prime/" title="How To Get Akjagara Prime">Akjagara Prime</a> have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Redeemer Prime and where you can farm these relics.</p><!--more--> <h2>Redeemer Prime Relics</h2> <p>So, Redeemer Prime parts scattered across four different relics:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Neo C1, Axi G2</b> that drop Redeemer Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Neo S12</b> that drops Redeemer Prime Blade </li>  <li> <b>Axi R2</b> that drops Redeemer Prime Handle </li>  </ul> <h2>Redeemer Prime Relics Farming</h2> <p>Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Redeemer Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Redeemer Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.</p>  <h3>How To Get Redeemer Prime Blueprint Relics</h3>    <p>For <b>Axi G2 Relics Farming</b> I would recommend <b>Xini on Eris</b>. It's an interception mission that's pretty straightforward. The first two rounds drop Neo relics and rounds 3 and 4 regularly dropping Axi relics. Optimally you want to stay four rounds before extracting.</p> <p>Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for <a href="/warframe-neurodes-farming/" title="Warframe Neurodes Farming">Neurodes</a></p>        <p>For <b>Neo C1 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Hydron on Sedna</b>. It is the fastest way to farm for Neo relics because Neo relics drop every 5 rounds. Also, it worth mentioned that Hydron is the best area to level up your Warframe and weapons. So, don't forget to bring alongside your weapons that you want to level up.</p>       <h3>How To Get Redeemer Prime Blade Relics</h3>    <p>   You    can get it by opening <b>Neo S12</b> Relics. To farm these relics, I suggest you go to the same mission which I've already mentioned in <em>How To Get Redeemer Prime Blueprint Relics</em> section.</p>    <h3>How To Get Redeemer Prime Handle Relics</h3>    <p>   You    can get it by opening <b>Axi R2</b> Relics. To farm these relics, I suggest you go to the same mission which I've already mentioned in <em>How To Get Redeemer Prime Blueprint Relics</em> section.</p>     <p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Redeemer Prime relics.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Redeemer Prime Relics Farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
