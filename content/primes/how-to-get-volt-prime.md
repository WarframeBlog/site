<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Volt Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-odonata-prime/" title="How To Get Odonata Prime">Odonata Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Volt Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Volt Prime from the drop table. So, currently Volt Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Volt Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Volt Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Axi N3, Neo O1, Lith O2, Neo V1</b> that drop Volt Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Axi L4, Lith V1, Neo O1</b> that drop Volt Prime Systems Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Meso O3, Axi V8, Meso V2, Meso V3</b> that drop Volt Prime Chassis Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Neo V8, Axi V8, Axi V1</b> that drop Volt Prime Neuroptics Blueprint </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Volt Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Volt Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Volt Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Volt Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
