<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Scindo Prime</strong> along with the Hikou Prime and the Nyx Prime have emerged from the Prime Vault. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Scindo Prime and where you can farm these relics. </p><!--more--><h2>Scindo Prime Relics</h2><p>So, Scindo Prime parts scattered across three different relics:</p><ul><li><b>Axi S3</b> that drops Scindo Prime Blade</li><li><b>Lith B4</b> that drops Scindo Prime Blueprint</li><li><b>Meso N6</b> that drops Scindo Prime Handle</li></ul><h2>Scindo Prime Relics Farming</h2><h3>How To Get Scindo Prime Blade Relics</h3><p>You can obtain <b>Axi S3 Relics</b> from Aten - a mobile defense mission or Marduk - a sabotage mission. Both of them have a chance to drop a Neo relic as well.</p><h3>How To Get Scindo Prime Blueprint Relics</h3><p>For <strong>farming Lith B4 Relics</strong> the <b>Heppit</b> mission in the Void is a great option. It's a quick capture mission which you can repeat pretty quickly.</p><h3>How To Get Scindo Prime Handle Relics</h3><p>In order to farm <b>Meso N6 Relics</b>, I would recommend <b>Ukko</b> in the Void. It's a capture and can be completed really quickly.</p><p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Scindo Prime relics.</p><p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Scindo Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
