<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Scindo Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-nyx-prime/" title="How To Get Nyx Prime">Nyx Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-hikou-prime/" title="How To Get Hikou Prime">Hikou Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Scindo Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Scindo Prime from the drop table. So, currently Scindo Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Scindo Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Scindo Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Axi S3, Axi S1</b> that drop Scindo Prime Blade </li>  <li> <b>Meso N6, Meso C1</b> that drop Scindo Prime Handle </li>  <li> <b>Lith F1, Lith B4</b> that drop Scindo Prime Blueprint </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Scindo Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Scindo Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Scindo Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Scindo Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
