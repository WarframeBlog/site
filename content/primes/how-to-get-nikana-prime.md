<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Nikana Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-saryn-prime/" title="How To Get Saryn Prime">Saryn Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-spira-prime/" title="How To Get Spira Prime">Spira Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Nikana Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Nikana Prime from the drop table. So, currently Nikana Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Nikana Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Nikana Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Axi N6, Axi N4, Axi N2, Neo N6</b> that drop Nikana Prime Hilt </li>  <li> <b>Neo S10, Meso N4, Neo N4, Meso V2</b> that drop Nikana Prime Blade </li>  <li> <b>Axi N6, Neo S8, Neo N5, Axi A1</b> that drop Nikana Prime Blueprint </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Nikana Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Nikana Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Nikana Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Nikana Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
