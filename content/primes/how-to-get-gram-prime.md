Hey guys. And the [Chroma Prime](/primes/how-to-get-chroma-prime/ "How To Get Chroma Prime") along with [Rubico Prime](/primes/how-to-get-rubico-prime/ "How To Get Rubico Prime") and Gram Prime have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Gram Prime and where you can farm these relics. <!--more-->

## Gram Prime Relics
So, Gram Prime parts scattered across three different relics:

* <b>Meso S8 relic</b> that drops the Gram Prime Blade as a common drop
* <b>Neo G1 relic</b> that drops the Gram Prime Handle as a rare drop
* <b>Axi O4 relic</b> that drops the Gram Prime Blueprint as an uncommon drop

## Gram Prime Relics Farming
Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Gram Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Gram Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.

### How To Get Gram Prime Blade relics
In order to farm Meso T3, I would recommend IO on Jupiter. This mission can be completed really quickly and with some luck, you should be able to get two Meso relics in 10 waves.

### How To Get Gram Prime Handle relics
For Neo relics, my recommendation is Hydron on Sedna. It is the fastest way to farm for Neo relics because Neo relics drop every 5 rounds. Also, it worth mentioned that Hydron is the best area to level up your Warframe and weapons. So, don't forget to bring alongside your weapons that you want to level up.

### How To Get Gram Prime Blueprint relics
For Axi relics farming I would recommend Xini on Eris. It's an interception mission that's pretty straightforward. The first two rounds drop Neo relics and rounds 3 and 4 regularly dropping Axi relics. Optimally you want to stay four rounds before extracting.
Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for Neurodes.

And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Gram Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck farming that popular heavy blade. Bye-bye.
