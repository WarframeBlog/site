<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Ninkondi Prime</strong> along with Zhuge Prime and Wukong Prime have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Ninkondi Prime and where you can farm these relics.</p><!--more--><h2>Ninkondi Prime Relics</h2><p>So, Ninkondi Prime parts scattered across three different relics:</p><ul> <li> <b>Axi P1</b> that drops Ninkondi Prime Chain </li><li> <b>Meso N7</b> that drops Ninkondi Prime Handle </li><li> <b>Neo R2</b> that drops Ninkondi Prime Blueprint </li></ul><h2>Ninkondi Prime Relics Farming</h2><p>Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Ninkondi Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Ninkondi Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.</p><h3>How To Get Ninkondi Prime Blueprint Relics</h3> <p>For <b>Neo R2 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Hydron on Sedna</b>. It is the fastest way to farm for Neo relics because Neo relics drop every 5 rounds. Also, it worth mentioned that Hydron is the best area to level up your Warframe and weapons. So, don't forget to bring alongside your weapons that you want to level up.</p><h3>How To Get Ninkondi Prime Handle Relics</h3> <p>In order to farm <b>Meso N7 Relics</b> , I would recommend <b>Io on Jupiter</b>. This mission can be completed really quickly and with some luck, you should be able to get two Meso relics in 10 waves.</p><h3>How To Get Ninkondi Prime Chain Relics</h3> <p>For <b>Axi P1 Relics Farming</b> I would recommend <b>Xini on Eris</b>. It's an interception mission that's pretty straightforward. The first two rounds drop Neo relics and rounds 3 and 4 regularly dropping Axi relics. Optimally you want to stay four rounds before extracting.</p><p>Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for <a href="/warframe-neurodes-farming/" title="Warframe Neurodes Farming">Neurodes</a></p><p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Ninkondi Prime relics.</p><p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Ninkondi Prime Relics Farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
