Hey guys. And the Chroma Prime along with [Rubico Prime](/primes/how-to-get-rubico-prime/ "How To Get Rubico Prime") and [Gram Prime](/primes/how-to-get-gram-prime/ "How To Get Gram Prime") have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Chroma Prime and where you can farm these relics. <!--more-->

## Chroma Prime Relics
So, [Chroma](/warframes/chroma/ "Warframe Chroma") Prime parts scattered across four different relics:

* <b>Lith C3 relic</b> that drops the Chroma Prime Neuroprtics as a rare drop
* <b>Meso T3 relic</b> that drops the Chroma Prime Chassis as an uncommon drop
* <b>Neo K2 relic</b> that drops the Chroma Prime Blueprint as a common drop
* <b>Axi C3 relic</b> that drops the Chroma Prime Systems as a rare drop

## Chroma Prime Relics Farming
Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Chroma Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Chroma Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.

### How To Get Chroma Prime Neuroprtics relics
So, for farming Lith relics the Orokin Derelict Defense mission is a great option. ODD is a straightforward defense mission that you can even solo with banshee and you should be able to get two Lith relics in 10 waves most of the time.

### How To Get Chroma Prime Chassis relics
In order to farm Meso relics, I would recommend IO on Jupiter. This mission can be completed really quickly and with some luck, you should be able to get two Meso relics in 10 waves.

### How To Get Chroma Prime Blueprint relics
For Neo relics, my recommendation is Hydron on Sedna. It is the fastest way to farm for Neo relics because Neo relics drop every 5 rounds. Also, it worth mentioned that Hydron is the best area to level up your Warframe and weapons. So, don't forget to bring alongside your weapons that you want to level up.

### How To Get Chroma Prime Systems relics
For Axi relics farming I would recommend Xini on Eris. It's an interception mission that's pretty straightforward. The first two rounds drop Neo relics and rounds 3 and 4 regularly dropping Axi relics. Optimally you want to stay four rounds before extracting.

Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for [Neurodes](/warframe-neurodes-farming/ "Warframe Neurodes Farming
").

And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Chroma Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck farming that Golder Dragon. Bye-bye.
