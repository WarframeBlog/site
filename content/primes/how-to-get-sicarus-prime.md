<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Sicarus Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-ember-prime/" title="How To Get Ember Prime">Ember Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-glaive-prime/" title="How To Get Glaive Prime">Glaive Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Sicarus Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Sicarus Prime from the drop table. So, currently Sicarus Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Sicarus Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Sicarus Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Meso F2, Neo F1</b> that drop Sicarus Prime Barrel </li>  <li> <b>Neo S5, Axi S2</b> that drop Sicarus Prime Receiver </li>  <li> <b>Axi E1, Neo F1</b> that drop Sicarus Prime Blueprint </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Sicarus Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Sicarus Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Sicarus Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Sicarus Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
