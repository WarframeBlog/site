Hey guys. And the [Mesa Prime](/primes/how-to-get-mesa-prime/ "How To Get Mesa Prime") along with Akjagara Prime and [Rede﻿emer Prime﻿](/primes/how-to-get-redeemer-prime/ "How To Get Redeemer Prime") have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Akjagara Prime and where you can farm these relics. <!--more-->

## Akjagara Prime Relics
So, Akjagara Prime parts scattered across four different relics:

* <b>Meso A1 relic</b> that drops the Akjagara Prime Barrel as a rare drop
* <b>Meso M2 relic</b> that drops the Akjagara Prime Link as an uncommon drop
* <b>Neo S9 relic</b> that drops the Akjagara Prime Blueprint as an uncommon drop
* <b>Axi L3 relic</b> that drops the Akjagara Prime Receiver as an uncommon drop

## Akjagara Prime Relics Farming
Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Akjagara Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Akjagara Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.

### How To Get Akjagara Prime Barrel & Link relics
In order to farm <b>Meso relics</b>, I would recommend <b>IO on Jupiter</b>. This mission can be completed really quickly and with some luck, you should be able to get two Meso relics in 10 waves.

### How To Get Akjagara Prime Blueprint relics
For <b>Neo relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Hydron on Sedna</b>. It is the fastest way to farm for Neo relics because Neo relics drop every 5 rounds. Also, it worth mentioned that Hydron is the best area to level up your Warframe and weapons. So, don't forget to bring alongside your weapons that you want to level up.

### How To Get Akjagara Prime Receiver relics
For <b>Axi relics farming</b> I would recommend <b>Xini on Eris</b>. It's an interception mission that's pretty straightforward. The first two rounds drop Neo relics and rounds 3 and 4 regularly dropping Axi relics. Optimally you want to stay four rounds before extracting.

Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for [Neurodes](/warframe-neurodes-farming/ "Warframe Neurodes Farming
").

## Farming Akjagara Prime Relics in the Void
Another way to farm Akjagara Prime relics is Void missions. Go with Hepit(Capture mission) as your source of Lith relics and Aten(mobile defense mission) or Marduk(sabotage mission) as your Neo and Axi relics places to farm. 

## Farming Akjagara Prime Relics in Bounties
Bounties are a fantastic way to get relics as well. You can take up the bounties from Cetus of [Fortuna](/fortuna/ "Warframe Fortuna") both will yield similar results. With tier 2 bounties granting Lith relics, tier 4 bounties granting Neo relics, and tier 5 bounties granting Axi relics.

## Farming Akjagara Prime Relics in Sanctuary Onslaught
Also, you can get Akjagara Prime relics by playing [Sanctuary Onslaught mode](/sanctuary-onslaught-guide/ "Sanctuary Onslaught Guide"). Upon completing the normal version of Sanctuary Onslaught you will be rewarded with Lith relics on rotation A and Neo relics on rotation C. And the Elite Sanctuary Onslaught will reward you with Lith relics on rotation A, Neo relics on rotation B, and Axi relics on rotation C.

Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Akjagara Prime relics.

And that’s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Akjagara Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck farming that dual pistols. Bye-bye.
