<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Spira Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-saryn-prime/" title="How To Get Saryn Prime">Saryn Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-nikana-prime/" title="How To Get Nikana Prime">Nikana Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Spira Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Spira Prime from the drop table. So, currently Spira Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Spira Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Spira Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Neo S10, Neo S3, Lith S5, Meso S6</b> that drop Spira Prime Blade </li>  <li> <b>Meso S9, Lith V4, Meso V1, Meso V3, Lith N2, Meso V5</b> that drop Spira Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Neo S8, Meso S9, Lith S1, Lith S3, Lith S6, Meso S3</b> that drop Spira Prime Pouch </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Spira Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Spira Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Spira Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Spira Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
