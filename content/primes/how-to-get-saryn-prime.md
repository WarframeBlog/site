<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Saryn Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-spira-prime/" title="How To Get Spira Prime">Spira Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-nikana-prime/" title="How To Get Nikana Prime">Nikana Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Saryn Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Saryn Prime from the drop table. So, currently Saryn Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Saryn Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Saryn Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Axi N6, Lith S4, Neo S1, Meso C3, Meso S4</b> that drop Saryn Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Neo S10, Meso S2, Neo S2</b> that drop Saryn Prime Chassis Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Meso S9, Lith A1, Neo V4, Meso S5</b> that drop Saryn Prime Neuroptics Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Lith H1, Neo S10, Meso N4, Neo N5, Meso F1, Meso C1, Axi T1, Axi G1</b> that drop Saryn Prime Systems Blueprint </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Saryn Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Saryn Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Saryn Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Saryn Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
