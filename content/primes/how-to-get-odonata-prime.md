<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Odonata Prime</strong> and the Volt Prime have emerged from the Prime Vault. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Odonata Prime and where you can farm these relics. </p><!--more--><h2>Odonata Prime Relics</h2><p>So, Odonata Prime parts scattered across five different relics:</p><ul><li><b>Neo V8</b> that drops Odonata Prime Harness Blueprint</li><li><b>Axi L4</b> that drops Odonata Prime Blueprint</li><li><b>Lith O2, Meso O3</b> that drop Odonata Prime Wings Blueprint</li><li><b>Meso O3</b> that drops Odonata Prime Systems Blueprint</li></ul><h2>Odonata Prime Relics Farming</h2><h3>How To Get Odonata Prime Harness Blueprint Relics</h3><p>For <b>Neo V8 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Belenus</b> in the Void. Belenus is a straightforward defense mission best attempted with a team and you should be able to get two Neo relics in 10 waves most of the time(or one Meso and one Neo).</p><h3>How To Get Odonata Prime Blueprint Relics</h3><p>You can obtain <b>Axi L4 Relics</b> from Aten - a mobile defense mission or Marduk - a sabotage mission. Both of them have a chance to drop a Neo relic as well.</p><p>Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for [Neurodes](/warframe-neurodes-farming/ "Warframe Neurodes Farming").</p><h3>How To Get Odonata Prime Wings Blueprint Relics</h3><p>For <strong>farming Lith O2 Relics</strong> the <b>Heppit</b> mission in the Void is a great option. It's a quick capture mission which you can repeat pretty quickly.</p><p>In order to farm <b>Meso O3 Relics</b>, I would recommend <b>Ukko</b> in the Void. It's a capture and can be completed really quickly.</p><h3>How To Get Odonata Prime Systems Relics</h3><p>You can get it by opening <b>Meso O3 Relics</b>. To farm these relics, I suggest you go to the same mission which I've already mentioned in _"How To Get Odonata Prime Wings Blueprint Relics"_ section.</p><p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Odonata Prime relics.</p><p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Odonata Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
