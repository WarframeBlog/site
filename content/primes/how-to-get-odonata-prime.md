<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Odonata Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-volt-prime/" title="How To Get Volt Prime">Volt Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Odonata Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Odonata Prime from the drop table. So, currently Odonata Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Odonata Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Odonata Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Axi L4, Lith F1, Axi V8, Meso S1, Meso C2</b> that drop Odonata Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Meso O3, Neo O1, Axi N1, Lith O2</b> that drop Odonata Prime Wings Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Axi K1, Neo V8, Neo O1, Axi V4, Lith K1, Axi T1</b> that drop Odonata Prime Harness Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Meso O3, Neo N3, Lith F2, Axi V8, Axi V1</b> that drop Odonata Prime Systems Blueprint </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Odonata Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Odonata Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Odonata Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Odonata Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
