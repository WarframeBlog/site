<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Nyx Prime</strong> along with the Hikou Prime and the Scindo Prime have emerged from the Prime Vault. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Nyx Prime and where you can farm these relics. </p><!--more--><h2>Nyx Prime Relics</h2><p>So, Nyx Prime parts scattered across four different relics:</p><ul><li><b>Axi S3</b> that drops Nyx Prime Systems Blueprint</li><li><b>Lith B4</b> that drops Nyx Prime Blueprint</li><li><b>Meso N6</b> that drops Nyx Prime Neuroptics Blueprint</li><li><b>Neo R1</b> that drops Nyx Prime Chassis Blueprint</li></ul><h2>Nyx Prime Relics Farming</h2><h3>How To Get Nyx Prime Systems Relics</h3><p>You can obtain <b>Axi S3 Relics</b> from Aten - a mobile defense mission or Marduk - a sabotage mission. Both of them have a chance to drop a Neo relic as well.</p><h3>How To Get Nyx Prime Blueprint Relics</h3><p>For <strong>farming Lith B4 Relics</strong> the <b>Heppit</b> mission in the Void is a great option. It's a quick capture mission which you can repeat pretty quickly.</p><h3>How To Get Nyx Prime Neuroptics Relics</h3><p>In order to farm <b>Meso N6 Relics</b>, I would recommend <b>Ukko</b> in the Void. It's a capture and can be completed really quickly.</p><h3>How To Get Nyx Prime Chassis Relics</h3><p>For <b>Neo R1 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Belenus</b> in the Void. Belenus is a straightforward defense mission best attempted with a team and you should be able to get two Neo relics in 10 waves most of the time(or one Meso and one Neo).</p><p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Nyx Prime relics.</p><p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Nyx Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
