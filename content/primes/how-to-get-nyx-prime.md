<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Nyx Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-hikou-prime/" title="How To Get Hikou Prime">Hikou Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-scindo-prime/" title="How To Get Scindo Prime">Scindo Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Nyx Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Nyx Prime from the drop table. So, currently Nyx Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Nyx Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Nyx Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Axi S3, Neo S2</b> that drop Nyx Prime Systems Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Meso N6, Meso N1</b> that drop Nyx Prime Neuroptics Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Lith S2, Lith B4, Neo V1</b> that drop Nyx Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Neo N1, Neo R1</b> that drop Nyx Prime Chassis Blueprint </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Nyx Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Nyx Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Nyx Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Nyx Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
