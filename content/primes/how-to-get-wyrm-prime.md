<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Wyrm Prime</strong> along with the Bo Prime and the Loki Prime have emerged from the Prime Vault. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Wyrm Prime and where you can farm these relics. </p><!--more--><h2>Wyrm Prime Relics</h2><p>So, Wyrm Prime parts scattered across four different relics:</p><ul><li><b>Axi L4</b> that drops Wyrm Prime Carapace</li><li><b>Neo V8</b> that drops Wyrm Prime Blueprint</li><li><b>Lith O2</b> that drops Wyrm Prime Cerebrum</li><li><b>Meso O3</b> that drops Wyrm Prime Systems</li></ul><h2>Wyrm Prime Relics Farming</h2><h3>How To Get Wyrm Prime Carapace Relics</h3><p>You can obtain <b>Axi L4 Relics</b> from Aten - a mobile defense mission or Marduk - a sabotage mission. Both of them have a chance to drop a Neo relic as well.</p><p>Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for [Neurodes](/warframe-neurodes-farming/ "Warframe Neurodes Farming").</p><h3>How To Get Wyrm Prime Blueprint Relics</h3><p>For <b>Neo V8 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Belenus</b> in the Void. Belenus is a straightforward defense mission best attempted with a team and you should be able to get two Neo relics in 10 waves most of the time(or one Meso and one Neo).</p><h3>How To Get Wyrm Prime Cerebrum Relics</h3><p>For <strong>farming Lith O2 Relics</strong> the <b>Heppit</b> mission in the Void is a great option. It's a quick capture mission which you can repeat pretty quickly.</p><h3>How To Get Wyrm Prime Systems Relics</h3><p>In order to farm <b>Meso O3 Relics</b>, I would recommend <b>Ukko</b> in the Void. It's a capture and can be completed really quickly.</p><p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Wyrm Prime relics.</p><p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Wyrm Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
