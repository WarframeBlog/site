<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Wyrm Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-bo-prime/" title="How To Get Bo Prime">Bo Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-loki-prime/" title="How To Get Loki Prime">Loki Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Wyrm Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Wyrm Prime from the drop table. So, currently Wyrm Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Wyrm Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Wyrm Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Axi L4, Axi L1</b> that drop Wyrm Prime Carapace </li>  <li> <b>Meso O3, Meso E1</b> that drop Wyrm Prime Systems </li>  <li> <b>Neo V8, Neo E1, Axi S2</b> that drop Wyrm Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Lith G2, Lith O2</b> that drop Wyrm Prime Cerebrum </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Wyrm Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Wyrm Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Wyrm Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Wyrm Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
