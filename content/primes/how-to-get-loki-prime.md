<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Loki Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-bo-prime/" title="How To Get Bo Prime">Bo Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-wyrm-prime/" title="How To Get Wyrm Prime">Wyrm Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Loki Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Loki Prime from the drop table. So, currently Loki Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Loki Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Loki Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Neo V8, Meso F3, Axi S2</b> that drop Loki Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Axi L4, Axi L1</b> that drop Loki Prime Systems Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Lith G2, Lith O2</b> that drop Loki Prime Chassis Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Meso O3, Neo E1</b> that drop Loki Prime Neuroptics Blueprint </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Loki Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Loki Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Loki Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Loki Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
