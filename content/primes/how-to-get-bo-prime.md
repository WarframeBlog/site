<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Bo Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-loki-prime/" title="How To Get Loki Prime">Loki Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-wyrm-prime/" title="How To Get Wyrm Prime">Wyrm Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Bo Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Bo Prime from the drop table. So, currently Bo Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Bo Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Bo Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Neo V8, Neo F1</b> that drop Bo Prime Handle </li>  <li> <b>Lith G2, Lith O2</b> that drop Bo Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Axi L4, Meso E1</b> that drop Bo Prime Ornament </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Bo Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Bo Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Bo Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Bo Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
