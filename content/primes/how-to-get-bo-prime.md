<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Bo Prime</strong> along with the Loki Prime and the Wyrm Prime have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--><h2>Bo Prime Vaulted</h2><p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Bo Prime from the drop table. So, currently Bo Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Bo Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay. </p><h2>How To Get Bo Prime</h2><p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p><ul><li><b>Axi A3, Axi T2, Meso M2, Neo G1</b> that drop Kogake Prime Boot</li><li><b>Axi R1, Axi S3</b> that drop Boltor Prime Stock</li><li><b>Axi R1, Axi S4, Lith M1</b> that drop Boar Prime Receiver</li><li><b>Axi V2, Lith M2, Meso M1</b> that drop Boar Prime Barrel</li><li><b>Lith B1, Meso B1, Meso B3</b> that drop Boar Prime Stock</li><li><b>Lith B1, Neo R1</b> that drop Boltor Prime Receiver</li><li><b>Lith B4, Neo B3</b> that drop Boltor Prime Blueprint</li><li><b>Lith G2</b> that drops Bo Prime Blueprint</li><li><b>Meso E1</b> that drops Bo Prime Ornament</li><li><b>Meso M1, Meso N6</b> that drop Boltor Prime Barrel</li><li><b>Neo B3, Neo D1, Neo N9</b> that drop Boar Prime Blueprint</li><li><b>Neo F1</b> that drops Bo Prime Handle</li></ul><p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Bo Prime relics from other players or wait until the Bo Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p><p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Bo Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Bo Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
