<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Bo Prime</strong> along with the Loki Prime and the Wyrm Prime have emerged from the Prime Vault. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Bo Prime and where you can farm these relics. </p><!--more--><h2>Bo Prime Relics</h2><p>So, Bo Prime parts scattered across three different relics:</p><ul><li><b>Axi L4</b> that drops Bo Prime Ornament</li><li><b>Lith O2</b> that drops Bo Prime Blueprint</li><li><b>Neo V8</b> that drops Bo Prime Handle</li></ul><h2>Bo Prime Relics Farming</h2><h3>How To Get Bo Prime Ornament Relics</h3><p>You can obtain <b>Axi L4 Relics</b> from Aten - a mobile defense mission or Marduk - a sabotage mission. Both of them have a chance to drop a Neo relic as well.</p><p>Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for [Neurodes](/warframe-neurodes-farming/ "Warframe Neurodes Farming").</p><h3>How To Get Bo Prime Blueprint Relics</h3><p>For <strong>farming Lith O2 Relics</strong> the <b>Heppit</b> mission in the Void is a great option. It's a quick capture mission which you can repeat pretty quickly.</p><h3>How To Get Bo Prime Handle Relics</h3><p>For <b>Neo V8 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Belenus</b> in the Void. Belenus is a straightforward defense mission best attempted with a team and you should be able to get two Neo relics in 10 waves most of the time(or one Meso and one Neo).</p><p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Bo Prime relics.</p><p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Bo Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
