Hey guys. And the Ember Prime along with Sicarus Prime and Glaive Prime﻿ have emerged from the Prime Vault. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Ember Prime and where you can farm these relics. <!--more-->

## Ember Prime Relics
So, Ember Prime parts scattered across four different relics:

* <b>Axi E1 Relic</b> that drops the Ember Prime Blueprint
* <b>Neo S5 Relic</b> that drops the Ember Prime Neuroptics
* <b>Meso F2 Relic</b> that drops the Ember Prime Chassis
* <b>Lith G1 Relic</b> that drops the Ember Prime Systems

## Ember Prime Relics Farming
Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Ember Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Ember Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.

### How To Get Ember Prime Blueprint relics
For <b>Axi relics farming</b> I would recommend <b>Xini on Eris</b>. It's an interception mission that's pretty straightforward. The first two rounds drop Neo relics and rounds 3 and 4 regularly dropping Axi relics. Optimally you want to stay four rounds before extracting.

Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for [Neurodes](/warframe-neurodes-farming/ "Warframe Neurodes Farming").

### How To Get Ember Prime Systems relics
So, for <strong>farming Lith relics</strong> the <b>Orokin Derelict Defense</b> mission is a great option. ODD is a straightforward defense mission that you can even solo with banshee and you should be able to get two Lith relics in 10 waves most of the time.

### How To Get Ember Prime Chassis relics
In order to farm Meso relics, I would recommend IO on Jupiter. This mission can be completed really quickly and with some luck, you should be able to get two Meso relics in 10 waves.

### How To Get Ember Prime Neuroptics relics
For <b>Neo relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Hydron on Sedna</b>. It is the fastest way to farm for Neo relics because Neo relics drop every 5 rounds. Also, it worth mentioned that Hydron is the best area to level up your Warframe and weapons. So, don't forget to bring alongside your weapons that you want to level up.

## Farming Ember Prime Relics in the Void
Another way to farm Ember Prime relics is Void missions. Go with Hepit(Capture mission) as your source of Lith relics and Aten(mobile defense mission) or Marduk(sabotage mission) as your Neo and Axi relics places to farm. 

## Farming Ember Prime Relics in Bounties
Bounties are a fantastic way to get relics as well. You can take up the bounties from Cetus of [Fortuna](/fortuna/ "Warframe Fortuna") both will yield similar results. With tier 2 bounties granting Lith relics, tier 3 bounties granting Meso relics, tier 4 bounties granting Neo relics, and tier 5 bounties granting Axi relics.

Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Ember Prime relics.

And that’s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Ember Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.
