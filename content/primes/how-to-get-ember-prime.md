<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Ember Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-sicarus-prime/" title="How To Get Sicarus Prime">Sicarus Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-glaive-prime/" title="How To Get Glaive Prime">Glaive Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Ember Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Ember Prime from the drop table. So, currently Ember Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Ember Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Ember Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Meso F2, Neo F1</b> that drop Ember Prime Chassis Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Meso E1, Neo E1, Axi E1</b> that drop Ember Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Lith G1, Axi S2</b> that drop Ember Prime Systems Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Neo S5, Meso F3</b> that drop Ember Prime Neuroptics Blueprint </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Ember Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Ember Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Ember Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Ember Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
