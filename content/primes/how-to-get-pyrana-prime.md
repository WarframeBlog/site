Hey guys. And the Pyrana Prime along with Limbo Prime and Destreza Prime﻿ have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to **get Pyrana Prime** and where you can farm these relics. <!--more-->

## Pyrana Prime Relics
So, **Pyrana Prime parts** scattered across four different relics:

* <b>Axi C4, Neo A2</b> that drop the Pyrana Prime Barrel
* <b>Meso P1</b> that drops the Pyrana Prime Blueprint
* <b>Neo Z2</b> that drops the Pyrana Prime Receiver

## Pyrana Prime Relics Farming
Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Pyrana Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Pyrana Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.

### How To Get Pyrana Prime Barrel Relics

For <b>Axi C4 Relics farming</b> I would recommend <b>Xini on Eris</b>. It's an interception mission that's pretty straightforward. The first two rounds drop Neo relics and rounds 3 and 4 regularly dropping Axi relics. Optimally you want to stay four rounds before extracting.

Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for [Neurodes](/warframe-neurodes-farming/ "Warframe Neurodes Farming").

For <b>Neo A2 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Hydron on Sedna</b>. It is the fastest way to farm for Neo relics because Neo relics drop every 5 rounds. Also, it worth mentioned that Hydron is the best area to level up your Warframe and weapons. So, don't forget to bring alongside your weapons that you want to level up.

### How To Get Pyrana Prime Blueprint Relics

In order to farm <b>Meso P1 Relics</b>, I would recommend <b>IO on Jupiter</b>. This mission can be completed really quickly and with some luck, you should be able to get two Meso relics in 10 waves.

### How To Get Pyrana Prime Receiver Relics

You can get it by opening <b>Neo Z2 Relics</b>. To farm these relics, I suggest you go to the same mission which I've already mentioned in _"How To Get Pyrana Prime Barrel Relics"_ section.

And that’s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Pyrana Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.
