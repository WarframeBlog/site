<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Stradavar Prime</strong> along with Tipedo Prime and Equinox Prime have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Stradavar Prime and where you can farm these relics. </p><!--more--><h2>Stradavar Prime Relics</h2><p>So, Stradavar Prime parts scattered across four different relics:</p><ul><li><b>Axi T2</b> that drops Stradavar Prime Stock</li><li><b>Lith M4</b> that drops Stradavar Prime Barrel</li><li><b>Meso Z3</b> that drops Stradavar Prime Receiver</li><li><b>Neo S11</b> that drops Stradavar Prime Blueprint</li></ul><h2>Stradavar Prime Relics Farming</h2><p>Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Stradavar Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Stradavar Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.</p><h3>How To Get Stradavar Prime Stock Relics</h3><p>For <b>Axi T2 Relics farming</b> I would recommend <b>Xini on Eris</b>. It's an interception mission that's pretty straightforward. The first two rounds drop Neo relics and rounds 3 and 4 regularly dropping Axi relics. Optimally you want to stay four rounds before extracting.</p><p>Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for [Neurodes](/warframe-neurodes-farming/ "Warframe Neurodes Farming").</p><h3>How To Get Stradavar Prime Barrel Relics</h3><p>For <strong>farming Lith M4 Relics</strong> the <b>Orokin Derelict Defense</b> mission is a great option. ODD is a straightforward defense mission that you can even solo with Banshee and you should be able to get two Lith relics in 10 waves most of the time.</p><h3>How To Get Stradavar Prime Receiver Relics</h3><p>In order to farm <b>Meso Z3 Relics</b>, I would recommend <b>IO on Jupiter</b>. This mission can be completed really quickly and with some luck, you should be able to get two Meso relics in 10 waves.</p><h3>How To Get Stradavar Prime Blueprint Relics</h3><p>For <b>Neo S11 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Hydron on Sedna</b>. It is the fastest way to farm for Neo relics because Neo relics drop every 5 rounds. Also, it worth mentioned that Hydron is the best area to level up your Warframe and weapons. So, don't forget to bring alongside your weapons that you want to level up.</p><p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Stradavar Prime relics.</p><p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Stradavar Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
