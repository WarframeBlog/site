<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Rhino Prime</strong> along with the Ankyros Prime and the Boltor Prime have emerged from the Prime Vault. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Rhino Prime and where you can farm these relics. </p><!--more--><h2>Rhino Prime Relics</h2><p>So, Rhino Prime parts scattered across four different relics:</p><ul><li><b>Neo R1</b> that drops Rhino Prime Blueprint</li><li><b>Axi S3</b> that drops Rhino Prime Systems Blueprint</li><li><b>Lith B4</b> that drops Rhino Prime Neuroptics Blueprint</li><li><b>Meso N6</b> that drops Rhino Prime Chassis Blueprint</li></ul><h2>Rhino Prime Relics Farming</h2><h3>How To Get Rhino Prime Blueprint Relics</h3><p>For <b>Neo R1 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Belenus</b> in the Void. Belenus is a straightforward defense mission best attempted with a team and you should be able to get two Neo relics in 10 waves most of the time(or one Meso and one Neo).</p><h3>How To Get Rhino Prime Systems Relics</h3><p>You can obtain <b>Axi S3 Relics</b> from Aten - a mobile defense mission or Marduk - a sabotage mission. Both of them have a chance to drop a Neo relic as well.</p><h3>How To Get Rhino Prime Neuroptics Relics</h3><p>For <strong>farming Lith B4 Relics</strong> the <b>Heppit</b> mission in the Void is a great option. It's a quick capture mission which you can repeat pretty quickly.</p><h3>How To Get Rhino Prime Chassis Relics</h3><p>In order to farm <b>Meso N6 Relics</b>, I would recommend <b>Ukko</b> in the Void. It's a capture and can be completed really quickly.</p><p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Rhino Prime relics.</p><p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Rhino Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
