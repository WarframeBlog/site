<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Rhino Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-ankyros-prime/" title="How To Get Ankyros Prime">Ankyros Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-boltor-prime/" title="How To Get Boltor Prime">Boltor Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Rhino Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Rhino Prime from the drop table. So, currently Rhino Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Rhino Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Rhino Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Axi R1, Neo R1</b> that drop Rhino Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Neo B3, Axi S3</b> that drop Rhino Prime Systems Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Lith B1, Lith B4</b> that drop Rhino Prime Neuroptics Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Meso M1, Meso N6</b> that drop Rhino Prime Chassis Blueprint </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Rhino Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Rhino Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Rhino Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Rhino Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
