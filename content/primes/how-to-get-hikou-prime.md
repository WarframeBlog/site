<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Hikou Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-nyx-prime/" title="How To Get Nyx Prime">Nyx Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-scindo-prime/" title="How To Get Scindo Prime">Scindo Prime</a> have emerged from the Prime Vault. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Hikou Prime and where you can farm these relics.</p><!--more--> <h2>Hikou Prime Relics</h2> <p>So, Hikou Prime parts scattered across three different relics:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Meso N6</b> that drops Hikou Prime Pouch </li>  <li> <b>Neo R1</b> that drops Hikou Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Axi S3</b> that drops Hikou Prime Stars </li>  </ul> <h2>Hikou Prime Relics Farming</h2> <p>Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Hikou Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Hikou Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.</p>  <h3>How To Get Hikou Prime Blueprint Relics</h3>     <p>For <b>Neo R1 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Belenus in the Void</b>. Belenus is a straightforward defense mission best attempted with a team and you should be able to get two Neo relics in ten waves most of the time(or one Meso and one Neo).</p>     <h3>How To Get Hikou Prime Pouch Relics</h3>     <p>In order to farm <b>Meso N6 Relics</b>, I would recommend <b>Ukko in the Void</b>. It's a capture mission and can be completed really quickly.</p>     <h3>How To Get Hikou Prime Stars Relics</h3>     <p>You can obtain <b>Axi S3</b> Relics from Marduk - a sabotage mission. This mission has a chance to drop Neo relics as well.</p>     <p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Hikou Prime relics.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Hikou Prime Relics Farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
