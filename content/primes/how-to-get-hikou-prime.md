<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Hikou Prime</strong> along with the Nyx Prime and the Scindo Prime have emerged from the Prime Vault. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Hikou Prime and where you can farm these relics. </p><!--more--><h2>Hikou Prime Relics</h2><p>So, Hikou Prime parts scattered across three different relics:</p><ul><li><b>Meso N6</b> that drops Hikou Prime Pouch</li><li><b>Axi S3</b> that drops Hikou Prime Stars</li><li><b>Neo R1</b> that drops Hikou Prime Blueprint</li></ul><h2>Hikou Prime Relics Farming</h2><h3>How To Get Hikou Prime Pouch Relics</h3><p>In order to farm <b>Meso N6 Relics</b>, I would recommend <b>Ukko</b> in the Void. It's a capture and can be completed really quickly.</p><h3>How To Get Hikou Prime Stars Relics</h3><p>You can obtain <b>Axi S3 Relics</b> from Aten - a mobile defense mission or Marduk - a sabotage mission. Both of them have a chance to drop a Neo relic as well.</p><h3>How To Get Hikou Prime Blueprint Relics</h3><p>For <b>Neo R1 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Belenus</b> in the Void. Belenus is a straightforward defense mission best attempted with a team and you should be able to get two Neo relics in 10 waves most of the time(or one Meso and one Neo).</p><p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Hikou Prime relics.</p><p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Hikou Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
