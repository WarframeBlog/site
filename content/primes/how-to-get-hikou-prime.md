<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Hikou Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-nyx-prime/" title="How To Get Nyx Prime">Nyx Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-scindo-prime/" title="How To Get Scindo Prime">Scindo Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Hikou Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Hikou Prime from the drop table. So, currently Hikou Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Hikou Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Hikou Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Axi K1, Meso N6, Axi V2</b> that drop Hikou Prime Pouch </li>  <li> <b>Meso N2, Lith S1, Neo R1</b> that drop Hikou Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Lith F2, Neo N1, Axi S3</b> that drop Hikou Prime Stars </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Hikou Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Hikou Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Hikou Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Hikou Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
