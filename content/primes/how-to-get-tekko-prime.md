<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Tekko Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-atlas-prime/" title="How To Get Atlas Prime">Atlas Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-dethcube-prime/" title="How To Get Dethcube Prime">Dethcube Prime</a> have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Tekko Prime and where you can farm these relics.</p><!--more--> <h2>Tekko Prime Relics</h2> <p>So, Tekko Prime parts scattered across three different relics:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Lith L2</b> that drops Tekko Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Neo T2</b> that drops Tekko Prime Blade </li>  <li> <b>Meso W1</b> that drops Tekko Prime Gauntlet </li>  </ul> <h2>Tekko Prime Relics Farming</h2> <p>Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Tekko Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Tekko Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.</p>  <h3>How To Get Tekko Prime Blueprint Relics</h3>    <p>For <strong>farming Lith L2 Relics</strong> the <b>Orokin Derelict Defense</b> mission is a great option. ODD is a straightforward defense mission that you can even solo with Banshee and you should be able to get two Lith relics in 10 waves most of the time.</p>       <h3>How To Get Tekko Prime Blade Relics</h3>    <p>For <b>Neo T2 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Hydron on Sedna</b>. It is the fastest way to farm for Neo relics because Neo relics drop every 5 rounds. Also, it worth mentioned that Hydron is the best area to level up your Warframe and weapons. So, don't forget to bring alongside your weapons that you want to level up.</p>       <h3>How To Get Tekko Prime Gauntlet Relics</h3>    <p>In order to farm <b>Meso W1 Relics</b> , I would recommend <b>Io on Jupiter</b>. This mission can be completed really quickly and with some luck, you should be able to get two Meso relics in 10 waves.</p>        <p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Tekko Prime relics.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Tekko Prime Relics Farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
