<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Tipedo Prime</strong> along with Equinox Prime and Stradavar Prime have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Tipedo Prime and where you can farm these relics. </p><!--more--><h2>Tipedo Prime Relics</h2><p>So, Tipedo Prime parts scattered across three different relics:</p><ul><li><b>Axi T2</b> that drops Tipedo Prime Handle</li><li><b>Lith P2</b> that drops Tipedo Prime Blueprint</li><li><b>Neo N10</b> that drops Tipedo Prime Ornament</li></ul><h2>Tipedo Prime Relics Farming</h2><p>Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Tipedo Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Tipedo Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.</p><h3>How To Get Tipedo Prime Handle Relics</h3><p>For <b>Axi T2 Relics farming</b> I would recommend <b>Xini on Eris</b>. It's an interception mission that's pretty straightforward. The first two rounds drop Neo relics and rounds 3 and 4 regularly dropping Axi relics. Optimally you want to stay four rounds before extracting.</p><p>Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for [Neurodes](/warframe-neurodes-farming/ "Warframe Neurodes Farming").</p><h3>How To Get Tipedo Prime Blueprint Relics</h3><p>For <strong>farming Lith P2 Relics</strong> the <b>Orokin Derelict Defense</b> mission is a great option. ODD is a straightforward defense mission that you can even solo with Banshee and you should be able to get two Lith relics in 10 waves most of the time.</p><h3>How To Get Tipedo Prime Ornament Relics</h3><p>For <b>Neo N10 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Hydron on Sedna</b>. It is the fastest way to farm for Neo relics because Neo relics drop every 5 rounds. Also, it worth mentioned that Hydron is the best area to level up your Warframe and weapons. So, don't forget to bring alongside your weapons that you want to level up.</p><p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Tipedo Prime relics.</p><p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Tipedo Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
