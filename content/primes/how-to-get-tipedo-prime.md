<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Tipedo Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-equinox-prime/" title="How To Get Equinox Prime">Equinox Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-stradavar-prime/" title="How To Get Stradavar Prime">Stradavar Prime</a> have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Tipedo Prime and where you can farm these relics.</p><!--more--> <h2>Tipedo Prime Relics</h2> <p>So, Tipedo Prime parts scattered across twelve different relics:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Axi G2, Axi G2, Axi G2, Axi G2</b> that drop Tipedo Prime Ornament </li>  <li> <b>Axi T2, Axi T2, Axi T2, Axi T2</b> that drop Tipedo Prime Handle </li>  <li> <b>Meso A2, Meso A2, Meso A2, Meso A2</b> that drop Tipedo Prime Blueprint </li>  </ul> <h2>Tipedo Prime Relics Farming</h2> <p>Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Tipedo Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Tipedo Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.</p>  <h3>How To Get Tipedo Prime Ornament &amp; Tipedo Prime Handle Relics</h3>    <p>For <b>Axi T2/Axi G2 Relics Farming</b> I would recommend <b>Xini on Eris</b>. It's an interception mission that's pretty straightforward. The first two rounds drop Neo relics and rounds 3 and 4 regularly dropping Axi relics. Optimally you want to stay four rounds before extracting.</p> <p>Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for <a href="/warframe-neurodes-farming/" title="Warframe Neurodes Farming">Neurodes</a></p>       <h3>How To Get Tipedo Prime Blueprint Relics</h3>    <p>In order to farm <b>Meso A2 Relics</b> , I would recommend <b>Io on Jupiter</b>. This mission can be completed really quickly and with some luck, you should be able to get two Meso relics in 10 waves.</p>        <p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Tipedo Prime relics.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Tipedo Prime Relics Farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
