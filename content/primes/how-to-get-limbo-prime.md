<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Limbo Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-destreza-prime/" title="How To Get Destreza Prime">Destreza Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-pyrana-prime/" title="How To Get Pyrana Prime">Pyrana Prime</a> have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Limbo Prime and where you can farm these relics.</p><!--more--> <h2>Limbo Prime Relics</h2> <p>So, Limbo Prime parts scattered across seven different relics:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Lith L1</b> that drops Limbo Prime Neuroptics Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Neo M2, Meso T3</b> that drop Limbo Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Axi L5</b> that drops Limbo Prime Chassis Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Neo A2, Meso N7, Neo C1</b> that drop Limbo Prime Systems Blueprint </li>  </ul> <h2>Limbo Prime Relics Farming</h2> <p>Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Limbo Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Limbo Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.</p>  <h3>How To Get Limbo Prime Neuroptics Blueprint Relics</h3>    <p>For <strong>farming Lith L1 Relics</strong> the <b>Orokin Derelict Defense</b> mission is a great option. ODD is a straightforward defense mission that you can even solo with Banshee and you should be able to get two Lith relics in 10 waves most of the time.</p>       <h3>How To Get Limbo Prime Blueprint &amp; Limbo Prime Systems Blueprint Relics</h3>    <p>In order to farm <b>Meso N7/Meso T3 Relics</b> , I would recommend <b>Io on Jupiter</b>. This mission can be completed really quickly and with some luck, you should be able to get two Meso relics in 10 waves.</p>        <p>For <b>Neo M2/Neo A2/Neo C1 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Hydron on Sedna</b>. It is the fastest way to farm for Neo relics because Neo relics drop every 5 rounds. Also, it worth mentioned that Hydron is the best area to level up your Warframe and weapons. So, don't forget to bring alongside your weapons that you want to level up.</p>       <h3>How To Get Limbo Prime Chassis Blueprint Relics</h3>    <p>For <b>Axi L5 Relics Farming</b> I would recommend <b>Xini on Eris</b>. It's an interception mission that's pretty straightforward. The first two rounds drop Neo relics and rounds 3 and 4 regularly dropping Axi relics. Optimally you want to stay four rounds before extracting.</p> <p>Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for <a href="/warframe-neurodes-farming/" title="Warframe Neurodes Farming">Neurodes</a></p>        <p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Limbo Prime relics.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Limbo Prime Relics Farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
