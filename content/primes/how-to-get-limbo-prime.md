Hey guys. And the Limbo Prime along with Destreza Prime and Pyrana Prime﻿ have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to **get Limbo Prime** and where you can farm these relics. <!--more-->

## Limbo Prime Relics
So, **Limbo Prime parts** scattered across six different relics:

* <b>Axi L2</b> that drops the Limbo Prime Neuroptics Blueprint
* <b>Axi L3</b> that drops the Limbo Prime Chassis Blueprint
* <b>Lith B6, Neo A2</b> that drop the Limbo Prime Systems Blueprint
* <b>Meso T3, Neo M2</b> that drop the Limbo Prime Blueprint

## Limbo Prime Relics Farming
Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Limbo Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Limbo Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.

### How To Get Limbo Prime Neuroptics Blueprint & Limbo Prime Chassis Blueprint Relics

For <b>Axi L2 Relics farming</b> I would recommend <b>Xini on Eris</b>. It's an interception mission that's pretty straightforward. The first two rounds drop Neo relics and rounds 3 and 4 regularly dropping Axi relics. Optimally you want to stay four rounds before extracting.

Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for [Neurodes](/warframe-neurodes-farming/ "Warframe Neurodes Farming").

### How To Get Limbo Prime Systems Blueprint Relics

For <strong>farming Lith B6 Relics</strong> the <b>Orokin Derelict Defense</b> mission is a great option. ODD is a straightforward defense mission that you can even solo with banshee and you should be able to get two Lith relics in 10 waves most of the time.

For <b>Neo A2 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Hydron on Sedna</b>. It is the fastest way to farm for Neo relics because Neo relics drop every 5 rounds. Also, it worth mentioned that Hydron is the best area to level up your Warframe and weapons. So, don't forget to bring alongside your weapons that you want to level up.

### How To Get Limbo Prime Blueprint Relics

In order to farm <b>Meso T3 Relics</b>, I would recommend <b>IO on Jupiter</b>. This mission can be completed really quickly and with some luck, you should be able to get two Meso relics in 10 waves.

Besides that, you can get it by opening <b>Neo M2 Relics</b>. To farm these relics, I suggest you go to the same mission which I've already mentioned in _"How To Get Limbo Prime Systems Blueprint Relics" section_.

And that’s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Limbo Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.
