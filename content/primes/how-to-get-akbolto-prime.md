<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Akbolto Prime</strong> along with <a href="/primes/how-to-get-mirage-prime/" title="How To Get Mirage Prime">Mirage Prime</a> and <a href="/primes/how-to-get-kogake-prime/" title="How To Get Kogake Prime">Kogake Prime</a> have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more--> <h2>Akbolto Prime Vaulted</h2> <p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the Akbolto Prime from the drop table. So, currently Akbolto Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while Akbolto Prime relics were moved over to the Prime Vault and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Prime Vault will stay.</p> <h2>How To Get Akbolto Prime</h2> <p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p> <ul>  <li> <b>Lith V5, Lith C2, Lith A3, Lith O1</b> that drop Akbolto Prime Barrel </li>  <li> <b>Neo M1, Neo V7, Meso D3, Neo Z2, Axi G2</b> that drop Akbolto Prime Blueprint </li>  <li> <b>Lith W1, Neo K2, Meso E2, Lith S7, Axi H4, Neo N8</b> that drop Akbolto Prime Link </li>  <li> <b>Neo A2, Axi A3, Axi A4, Meso A2</b> that drop Akbolto Prime Receiver </li>  </ul> <p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy Akbolto Prime Relics from other players or wait until the Akbolto Prime eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p> <p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get Akbolto Prime</strong>. I hope this guide helped and let's hope Akbolto Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>
