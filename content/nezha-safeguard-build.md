Hey guys and today we’re gonna take a look at Nezha Safeguard Build which focuses more on Warding Halo ability.<!--more-->

So, for Nezha Safeguard Build, I’m using Energy Siphon as its aura but it's kind of up to you. You can use Energy Siphon for the extra energy, you can use Corrosive Projection to reduce the enemy armor, or you can even use Sprint Boost for more speed.

Then to absolutely roid up our Warding Halo I'm using Power Drift, Blind Rage, Transient Fortitude, Intensify, and Augur Secrets for over 300% of power strength. This adds a ton of health to Warding Halo and it makes it comparable to something like [Iron Skin](/rhino-iron-skin-build/ "Rhino Iron Skin Build"). 

After that I'm using Armored Agility for the extra armor which also skills Warding Halo but it also adds a little bit of extra sprint speed which is kind of nice on Nezha because he's pretty fast by default. 

Then I'm using the Safeguard augment which is one thing that Nezha does have that [Rhino](/rhino-roar-build/ "Rhino Roar Build") doesn't which allows you to cast Warding Halo on your allies at 50% efficiency. This is a really good augment for group play. It doesn't matter what kind of content you like doing. You could be doing the [Eidolon Teralyst](/how-kill-eidolon-teralyst-basics/ "How to kill an Eidolon Teralyst in Warframe"), you could be doing sorties or even just [Hydron](/affinity-how-level-up/ "How to Level up Correctly"). It's just really nice to be able to protect your allies as well, especially if you have some squishy frames in your parties something like [Banshee](/banshee-savage-silence-build/ "Banshee Savage Silence Build"). 

And to top it all off I'm using Streamline and fully ranked Fleeting Expertise to balance out Blind Rage and give me good efficiency. However, since you're most likely not going to be spamming abilities all the time you don't necessarily have to use both. So, you can easily sub-in something like Primed Continuity for extra duration. And you can choose to replace either one of these. It all depends on whether you want more duration or efficiency. 

Now, the Nezha Warding Halo Build is a very tanky but you have to be careful about your Warding Halo because if it goes down you only have 225 health and 225 shield. So, as soon as it goes down you need to refresh it or you're just gonna die. Luckily though the cast time on Warding Halo is fairly short so as long as you keep your eye out on the ability icons at the bottom right corner of the screen and you refresh it as soon as it goes down you should have no issues. 

And there really isn't much else to say about this [Nezha Build](/warframe-builds/ "Warframe Builds"). It's kind of like the Iron Skin build. You press a button and you don't die. And that's pretty much it. You can use Fire Walker to do a little bit of extra damage and boost your movement [speed](/volt-speed-build/ "Volt Speed Build") a little bit. Though I would very much recommend you sub in Primed Continuity or at least the standard version of the Continuity if you want to do that. Otherwise the energy drain is gonna be far too steep with the negative duration. 

You can also use Divine Spears to do damage and they're gonna do a ton with both the initial impalement and the follow-up slam. Just remember that you only have basic power range so the area you're gonna cover isn't gonna be that large. 

So, that’s pretty much it for the Nezha Safeguard Build. I hope you’ve enjoyed the article and it was helpful. And I’ll see you next time. Bye-Bye.
