Hey guys. As mentioned on the previous devstream Alerts are going to be replaced and now they have been. **Nightwave series one** is here and here's what you need to know about the rewards available and how to get them. 

## How Does Nightwave Work
So, a nightwave is an episodic radio show from Nora Night which will have several series. Each series offers unique rewards. There are *30 reward tiers* for each series and you'll require 10,000 standing to rank up each time. Standing can be earned by completing a couple of daily challenges or the several weekly and elite weekly challenges available. Weekly challenges will refresh based on the timer on the bottom left. 

## Nora's Wolf Creds Offerings Shop
For the Wolf of Saturn Six you'll also be able to obtain **Wolf Creds** from reaching certain reward tiers. You can spend these Wolf Creds in *Nora's Cred Offerings shop*. Here you're able to purchase [Nitain Extracts](/nitain-extract-farming/ "Nitain Extract Farming"), Orokin Catalysts, Orokin Reactors, Vauban parts, some mods, and a ton of cosmetic items. All put in from the previous alert system reward pull. These offerings will refresh at the same time as weekly challenges do.

## Nightwave:The Wolf of Saturn Six Ranking Rewards
Notable rewards are two weapon slots at tier four, a three forma bundle at tier seven, an Orokin Catalyst at tier eleven, the new Grakata augment mod(Wild Frenzy) at tier fourteen, [20,000 Kuva](/where-and-how-to-farm-kuva/ "Where And How To Farm Kuva") at tier 15, the new Mutalis Quanta augment mod(Bursting Mass) at tier 18, 20,000 Kuva at tier 19, the new Penta augment mod(Napalm Grenades) at tier 22, [Arcane Energize](/arcane-rework/ "Arcane Rework") at tier 25, another forma bundle at tier 27, and finally [Umbra](/excalibur-umbra-exalted-blade-build/ "Excalibur Umbra Exalted Blade Buil") forma at tier 29. 

## How To Complete Challenges
You don't have to activate any of the challenges to begin completing them. Just enter a mission and play as normal keeping the challenges in mind.

## How To Get Wolf Sledge
Finally, you will come across the Wolf himself randomly in any mission. He spawns like the [Stalker](/farming-stalker/ "Warframe Farming Stalker") except without any dialogue and flickering. Defeating him will give you parts of his new hammer - **Wolf Sledge** or random mods. You can also encounter his three minions in missions which require you to down them and capture them. Doing this gives you 50 reputation for each of them. 

Remember your tiers and Wolf Creds are only useful up to the point that Nightwave series one ends. Duration of this series will be about 10 weeks. Once the Wolf of Saturn Six ends your Wolf Creds are no longer usable and you will have to earn your tiers back all over again. And that's about it. Have fun with Nightwave and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.
