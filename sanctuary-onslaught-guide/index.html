And most interesting are a new frame Khora and a new game mode called Sanctuary Onslaught about which we are going to talk about today!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-access-sanctuary-onslaught">How to access Sanctuary Onslaught?</h2>

<p>Well, first of all, make sure that you already completed the New Strange Quest. After that, you can access Sanctuary Onslaught by going to any of the relays, going to Cephalon Simaris and selecting the &#8220;I wish to attend Sanctuary Onslaught&#8221; option.</p>

<p><img src="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/access-to-Sanctuary-Onslaught-1024x576.png" title="Warframe How to access Sanctuary Onslaught?" alt="How to access Sanctuary Onslaught by going to Cephalon Simaris" width="750" height="422" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1283" srcset="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/access-to-Sanctuary-Onslaught-1024x576.png 1024w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/access-to-Sanctuary-Onslaught-300x169.png 300w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/access-to-Sanctuary-Onslaught-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>

<p>This will transport you to the Sanctuary where you end up with three other party members shall commence and especially fierce attack, also known as Onslaught, hence the name.</p>

<p><img src="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Sanctuary-Onslaught-get-started-1024x576.png" title="Warframe Sanctuary Onslaught" alt="new game mode Sanctuary Onslaught" width="750" height="422" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1286" srcset="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Sanctuary-Onslaught-get-started-1024x576.png 1024w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Sanctuary-Onslaught-get-started-300x169.png 300w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Sanctuary-Onslaught-get-started-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>

<p>Now, this is basically the endless tower concept from Action RPGs with a twist. The game will pick a random tileset and then generate a very small mission. It&rsquo;s usually one to three rooms and it will then pick a random faction and spawn a random subset of that faction. So it&rsquo;s not just going to spawn Grineer, but sometimes you&rsquo;re going to get <a href="https://warframeblog.com/where-and-how-to-farm-kuva/">Kuva</a> Grineer instead. And the objective here is pretty simple, kill as many things as fast as possible because killing enemies gives you a conduit efficiency, and if you&rsquo;re not killing them fast enough and it goes down to zero, the Onslaught is over. Now, each zone will last two and a half minutes before the next conduit portal opens and you can go to the next one and you&rsquo;ll get a nice <a href="https://warframeblog.com/how-to-farm-focus-points/">focus</a> booster at the start. You basically get the <a href="https://warframeblog.com/what-focus-school-to-choose-after-second-dream-quest/">focus</a> pickup and it can get a nice chunk of focus right at the start.</p>

<p>Now, there is also a set amount of efficiencies stimulus pickups in each mission, and those will give you a nice boost to efficiency. However, the number of these changes based on the difficulty of the Onslaught but also the zone. So, if you&rsquo;re playing the normal version of Onslaught, you will start with four of these Efficiency Stimulus and it slowly goes down and by the time you get to zone 11, which is as far as I got this far, you will only have one. However, if you&rsquo;re playing the Elite Sanctuary Onslaught version, which we&rsquo;ll talk about in a little bit, even the first zone only has two. Now, as far as the rewards are concerned, you will get rotation A rewards after two and four zones. You will get rotation B rewards after six zones and rotation C rewards after eight zones.</p>

<h3 id="the-sanctuary-onslaught-rewards-drop-table">The Sanctuary Onslaught Rewards Drop Table</h3>

<p>You can see the rewards for the normal version of Onslaught down below which is basically a ton of <a href="https://warframeblog.com/how-to-farm-relics/">relics</a>, <a href="https://warframeblog.com/how-farm-endo/">endo</a>, Khora parts and Captura scenes:</p>

<p><img src="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/normal-Sanctuary-Onslaught-rewards.png" title="Warframe Sanctuary Onslaught Rewards Drop Table" alt="Sanctuary Onslaught normal version Rewards Drop Table" width="850" height="329" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1285" srcset="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/normal-Sanctuary-Onslaught-rewards.png 850w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/normal-Sanctuary-Onslaught-rewards-300x116.png 300w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/normal-Sanctuary-Onslaught-rewards-768x297.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>

<p>Now this version of Sanctuary Onslaught, which is the normal version, is completely random. It will always pop you into a random tileset versus a random enemy faction and you just get random rewards. However, that is not the case for the Elite version. The Elite version of the Sanctuary Onslaught can access the same way as the normal version. You simply select the Elite Sanctuary Onslaught option instead of the standard one.</p>

<p><img src="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/access-to-elite-Sanctuary-Onslaught-1024x576.png" title="Warframe Elite Sanctuary Onslaught" alt="how to access to the Elite Sanctuary Onslaught" width="750" height="422" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1282" srcset="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/access-to-elite-Sanctuary-Onslaught-1024x576.png 1024w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/access-to-elite-Sanctuary-Onslaught-300x169.png 300w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/access-to-elite-Sanctuary-Onslaught-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>

<p>Now, the rewards here are still random though different. You can actually get Peculiar mods in here, which should be mods that are basically just cosmetics. So, if you crit an enemy, you will, for example, plant flowers in them and ridiculous stuff like that. The tilesets and enemies should be the same and I&rsquo;m saying should, because I&rsquo;ve had some issues getting into it. It was fine the first time around, but the game did not want to let me do it again, and this will change every week so we can kind of learn the layout, we can learn the tilesets and the enemy types and we can push as far as we can to get as many rewards as possible.</p>

<h3 id="the-elite-sanctuary-onslaught-rewards-drop-table">The Elite Sanctuary Onslaught Rewards Drop Table</h3>

<p>And here are rewards for the Elite Sanctuary Onslaught (Update 22.18.7):</p>

<p><img src="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/elite-Sanctuary-Onslaught-rewards-1024x427.png" title="The Elite Sanctuary Onslaught Rewards Drop Table Warframe" alt="Rewards drop table that you can get from The Elite Sanctuary Onslaught" width="750" height="313" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1297" srcset="https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/elite-Sanctuary-Onslaught-rewards-1024x427.png 1024w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/elite-Sanctuary-Onslaught-rewards-300x125.png 300w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/elite-Sanctuary-Onslaught-rewards-768x320.png 768w, https://warframeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/elite-Sanctuary-Onslaught-rewards.png 1134w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="sanctuary-onslaught-new-best-way-to-level-up">Sanctuary Onslaught - New Best Way to Level Up</h3>

<p>Before this article is coming to an end, I want to talk about a certain benefit(besides relics, focus points and other stuff above) that the Elite Sanctuary Onslaught gives you and that is an insane amount of high-level enemies. And high-level enemies means lots of an <a href="https://warframeblog.com/affinity-mastery-rank/">affinity</a>!</p>

<p>Now, what you should do is to unequip all weapons except for one to <a href="https://warframeblog.com/affinity-how-level-up/">maximize the affinity gain</a> for this specific weapon (25% warframe, 75% weapon). So, with affinity booster, it takes 10 waves on Hydron from rank 0 to 30. But in the Elite Sanctuary Onslaught, you can rank up one weapon from 0 to 30 in just one zone! Even if you equip all of the three weapons you can rank them up in underneath 8 minutes (This works for the normal version of Onslaught too but requires a little bit more time).</p>

<p>Now, overall, I like this game mode. So far the enemies spawn super-fast. It was just a massacre all the way through. Though there are some issues with it. As of now, there are some serious frame rate issues whenever a new conduit portal spawns, drops my frame rates from 120 to like 5 or 10. Lots of people have been reporting crashes on like zones like 12 and above. And as I&rsquo;ve mentioned already, the game would bug out every time I would try to access the Elite version of Sanctuary Onslaught after my first try. However, that is going to get fixed over time. And that is pretty much all I wanted to talk about. So, I thank you very much for reading. And I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed the article and I will see you next time. Bye-bye.</p></article><div class="section section-blog-info">

        <p>Warframe has one of the best free-to-play model in the market right now. You can earn almost every single item in this game without paying actual money with weapons, inventory space even cosmetics. Every single thing is out there for you to earn, that being said, it&rsquo;s not easy to earn the in-game currency - platinum.
Now, if you&rsquo;re looking for an article that will teach you how to get a large amount of platinum very very quickly then this is not the article you want. Over my time with playing, I&rsquo;ve earned myself probably around 3500 plus platinum in game. Almost all of these have come in very small amounts, very very slowly. I have made a few large trades here and there but they&rsquo;re very few and far between. I&rsquo;ll be sharing my insights into what I feel is the best way to earn a steady constant amount of platinum.   </p>

        <p>Hello everyone and today we are going to discuss some tips on defeating the newly upgraded Hemocyte boss. The last event we all complained about the boss being a copy and paste of Lephantis and also we complained that the boss was very easy to kill and that it was weak. So, DE listened to that and this time they made it harder. Now it&rsquo;s much like fighting an Eidolon.
