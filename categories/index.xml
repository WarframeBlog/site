      <description>Every Melee Weapon in Warframe you can build in a thousand alternative ways, and there is plenty of room to tweak it on your end, therefore please don&amp;rsquo;t take it as if the Weapon Builds below are no longer changeable. You can copy any build exactly, and it&amp;rsquo;s going to work fine, of course, but I&amp;rsquo;d think of Melee Weapon Builds below as more of an inspiration for your builds because you can play around with different values: critical chance, attack speed, status chance, critical multiplier, damage, and even type of damage.</description>

      <description>Every Secondary Weapon in Warframe you can build in a thousand various ways, and there is plenty of room to tweak it on your end, therefore please don&amp;rsquo;t take it as if the Weapon Builds below were carved in stone. You can copy any build precisely, and it&amp;rsquo;s going to work fine, of course, but I&amp;rsquo;d think of Secondary Weapon Builds below as more of an inspiration for your builds because you can play around with different values: critical chance, status chance, critical multiplier, damage, and even type of damage.</description>

      <description>Each warframe you can build in a thousand different ways and there’s a lot of room for tweaking on your end, so please don’t take it as if builds below were set in stone. You can of course copy builds exactly and it’s going to work just fine, but I would think about Warframe Builds below as more of an inspiration for your own builds because you can play around with different values: duration, efficiency, range, and even strength.</description>
